       "  'abstract': 'logit dynamics [blume, games and economic behavior, 1993] are randomized best response dynamics for strategic games: at every time step a player is selected uniformly at random and she chooses a new strategy according to a probability distribution biased toward strategies promising higher payoffs. this process defines an ergodic markov chain, over the set of strategy profiles of the game, whose unique stationary distribution is the long-term equilibrium concept for the game. however, when the mixing time of the chain is large (e.g., exponential in the number of players), the stationary distribution loses its appeal as equilibrium concept, and the transient phase of the markov chain becomes important. it can happen that the chain is \"metastable\", i.e., on a time-scale shorter than the mixing time, it stays close to some probability distribution over the state space, while in a time-scale multiple of the mixing time it jumps from one distribution to another.   in this paper we give a quantitative definition of \"metastable probability distributions\" for a markov chain and we study the metastability of the logit dynamics for some classes of coordination games. we first consider a pure $n$-player coordination game that highlights the distinctive features of our metastability notion based on distributions. then, we study coordination games on the clique without a risk-dominant strategy (which are equivalent to the well-known glauber dynamics for the curie-weiss model) and coordination games on a ring (both with and without risk-dominant strategy).',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"given two polygonal curves in the plane, there are many ways to define a notion of similarity between them. one popular measure is the fr\\\\'echet distance. since it was proposed by alt and godau in 1992, many variants and extensions have been studied. nonetheless, even more than 20 years later, the original $o(n^2 \\\\log n)$ algorithm by alt and godau for computing the fr\\\\'echet distance remains the state of the art (here, $n$ denotes the number of edges on each curve). this has led helmut alt to conjecture that the associated decision problem is 3sum-hard.   in recent work, agarwal et al. show how to break the quadratic barrier for the discrete version of the fr\\\\'echet distance, where one considers sequences of points instead of polygonal curves. building on their work, we give a randomized algorithm to compute the fr\\\\'echet distance between two polygonal curves in time $o(n^2 \\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}(\\\\log\\\\log n)^{3/2})$ on a pointer machine and in time $o(n^2(\\\\log\\\\log n)^2)$ on a word ram. furthermore, we show that there exists an algebraic decision tree for the decision problem of depth $o(n^{2-\\\\varepsilon})$, for some $\\\\varepsilon > 0$. we believe that this reveals an intriguing new aspect of this well-studied problem. finally, we show how to obtain the first subquadratic algorithm for computing the weak fr\\\\'echet distance on a word ram.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'as a well-known clustering algorithm, fuzzy c-means (fcm) allows each input sample to belong to more than one cluster, providing more flexibility than non-fuzzy clustering methods. however, the accuracy of fcm is subject to false detections caused by noisy records, weak feature selection and low certainty of the algorithm in some cases. the false detections are very important in some decision-making application domains like network security and medical diagnosis, where weak decisions based on such false detections may lead to catastrophic outcomes. they are mainly emerged from making decisions about a subset of records that do not provide enough evidence to make a good decision. in this paper, we propose a method for detecting such ambiguous records in fcm by introducing a certainty factor to decrease invalid detections. this approach enables us to send the detected ambiguous records to another discrimination method for a deeper investigation, thus increasing the accuracy by lowering the error rate. most of the records are still processed quickly and with low error rate which prevents performance loss compared to similar hybrid methods. experimental results of applying the proposed method on several datasets from different domains show a significant decrease in error rate as well as improved sensitivity of the algorithm.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'cloud radio access network (c-ran) is a promising architecture for unprecedented capacity enhancement in next-generation wireless networks thanks to the centralization and virtualization of base station processing. however, centralized signal processing in c-rans involves high computational complexity that quickly becomes unaffordable when the network grows to a huge size. among the first, this paper endeavours to design a scalable uplink signal detection algorithm, in the sense that both the complexity per unit network area and the total computation time remain constant when the network size grows. to this end, we formulate the signal detection in c-ran as an inference problem over a bipartite random geometric graph. by passing messages among neighboring nodes, message passing (a.k.a. belief propagation) provides an efficient way to solve the inference problem over a sparse graph. however, the traditional message-passing algorithm is not guaranteed to converge, because the corresponding bipartite random geometric graph is locally dense and contains many short loops. as a major contribution of this paper, we propose a randomized gaussian message passing (rgmp) algorithm to improve the convergence. instead of exchanging messages simultaneously or in a fixed order, we propose to exchange messages asynchronously in a random order. the proposed rgmp algorithm demonstrates significantly better convergence performance than conventional message passing. the randomness of the message update schedule also simplifies the analysis, and allows the derivation of the convergence conditions for the rgmp algorithm. in addition, we propose a blockwise rgmp (b-rgmp) algorithm for practical implementation. the average computation time of b-rgmp remains constant when the network size increases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'tensor compressive sensing (tcs) is a multidimensional framework of compressive sensing (cs), and it is advantageous in terms of reducing the amount of storage, easing hardware implementations and preserving multidimensional structures of signals in comparison to a conventional cs system. in a tcs system, instead of using a random sensing matrix and a predefined dictionary, the average-case performance can be further improved by employing an optimized multidimensional sensing matrix and a learned multilinear sparsifying dictionary. in this paper, we propose a joint optimization approach of the sensing matrix and dictionary for a tcs system. for the sensing matrix design in tcs, an extended separable approach with a closed form solution and a novel iterative non-separable method are proposed when the multilinear dictionary is fixed. in addition, a multidimensional dictionary learning method that takes advantages of the multidimensional structure is derived, and the influence of sensing matrices is taken into account in the learning process. a joint optimization is achieved via alternately iterating the optimization of the sensing matrix and dictionary. numerical experiments using both synthetic data and real images demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'this paper presents a new approach, called perturb-max, for high-dimensional statistical inference that is based on applying random perturbations followed by optimization. this framework injects randomness to maximum a-posteriori (map) predictors by randomly perturbing the potential function for the input. a classic result from extreme value statistics asserts that perturb-max operations generate unbiased samples from the gibbs distribution using high-dimensional perturbations. unfortunately, the computational cost of generating so many high-dimensional random variables can be prohibitive. however, when the perturbations are of low dimension, sampling the perturb-max prediction is as efficient as map optimization. this paper shows that the expected value of perturb-max inference with low dimensional perturbations can be used sequentially to generate unbiased samples from the gibbs distribution. furthermore the expected value of the maximal perturbations is a natural bound on the entropy of such perturb-max models. a measure concentration result for perturb-max values shows that the deviation of their sampled average from its expectation decays exponentially in the number of samples, allowing effective approximation of the expectation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the key challenge to improving performance in the age of dark silicon is how to leverage transistors when they cannot all be used at the same time. in modern socs, these transistors are often used to create specialized accelerators which improve energy efficiency for some applications by 10-1000x. while this might seem like the magic bullet we need, for most cpu applications more energy is dissipated in the memory system than in the processor: these large gains in efficiency are only possible if the dram and memory hierarchy are mostly idle. we refer to this desirable state as dark memory, and it only occurs for applications with an extreme form of locality.   to show our findings, we introduce pareto curves in the energy/op and mm$^2$/(ops/s) metric space for compute units, accelerators, and on-chip memory/interconnect. these pareto curves allow us to solve the power, performance, area constrained optimization problem to determine which accelerators should be used, and how to set their design parameters to optimize the system. this analysis shows that memory accesses create a floor to the achievable energy-per-op. thus high performance requires dark memory, which in turn requires co-design of the algorithm for parallelism and locality, with the hardware.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'motivated by the practical constraints arising in emerging sensor network and internet-of-things (iot) applications, the zero-delay transmission of a gaussian measurement over a real single-input multiple-output (simo) additive white gaussian noise (awgn) channel is studied with a low-resolution analog-to-digital converter (adc) front end. joint optimization of the encoder and the decoder mapping is tackled under both the mean squared error (mse) distortion and the distortion outage probability (dop) criteria, with an average power constraint on the channel input. optimal encoder and decoder mappings are identified for a one-bit adc front end under both criteria. for the mse distortion, the optimal encoder mapping is shown to be non-linear in general, while it tends to a linear encoder in the low signal-to-noise ratio (snr) regime, and to an antipodal digital encoder in the high snr regime. this is in contrast to the optimality of linear encoding at all snr values in the presence of a full-precision front end. for the dop criterion, it is shown that the optimal encoder mapping is piecewise constant and can take only two opposite values when it is non-zero. for both the mse distortion and the dop criteria, necessary optimality conditions are then derived for $k$-level adc front ends as well as front ends with multiple one-bit adcs. these conditions are used to obtain numerically optimized solutions. extensive numerical results are also provided in order to gain insights into the structure of the optimal encoding and decoding mappings.',\n",

       "  'id': '1607.02104',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'zero-shot learning for visual recognition, e.g., object and action recognition, has recently attracted a lot of attention. however, it still remains challenging in bridging the semantic gap between visual features and their underlying semantics and transferring knowledge to semantic categories unseen during learning. unlike most of the existing zero-shot visual recognition methods, we propose a stagewise bidirectional latent embedding framework to two subsequent learning stages for zero-shot visual recognition. in the bottom-up stage, a latent embedding space is first created by exploring the topological and labeling information underlying training data of known classes via a proper supervised subspace learning algorithm and the latent embedding of training data are used to form landmarks that guide embedding semantics underlying unseen classes into this learned latent space. in the top-down stage, semantic representations of unseen-class labels in a given label vocabulary are then embedded to the same latent space to preserve the semantic relatedness between all different classes via our proposed semi-supervised sammon mapping with the guidance of landmarks. thus, the resultant latent embedding space allows for predicting the label of a test instance with a simple nearest-neighbor rule. to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we have conducted extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets in object and action recognition, i.e., awa, cub-200-2011, ucf101 and hmdb51. the experimental results under comparative studies demonstrate that our proposed approach yields the state-of-the-art performance under inductive and transductive settings.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'we describe a simple and fast algorithm for identifying friends-of-friends features and prove its correctness. the algorithm avoids unnecessary expensive neighbor queries, uses minimal memory overhead, and rejects slowdown in high over-density regions. we define our algorithm formally based on pair enumeration, a problem that has been heavily studied in fast 2-point correlation codes and our reference implementation employs a dual kd-tree correlation function code. we construct features in a hierarchical tree structure, and use a splay operation to reduce the average cost of identifying the root of a feature from $o[\\\\log l]$ to $o[1]$ ($l$ is the size of a feature) without additional memory costs. this reduces the overall time complexity of merging trees from $o[l\\\\log l]$ to $o[l]$, reducing the number of operations per splay by orders of magnitude. we next introduce a pruning operation that skips merge operations between two fully self-connected kd-tree nodes. this improves the robustness of the algorithm, reducing the number of merge operations in high density peaks from $o[\\\\delta^2]$ to $o[\\\\delta]$. we show that for cosmological data set the algorithm eliminates more than half of merge operations for typically used linking lengths $b \\\\sim 0.2$ (relative to mean separation). furthermore, our algorithm is extremely simple and easy to implement on top of an existing pair enumeration code, reusing the optimization effort that has been invested in fast correlation function codes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'this paper deals with a new filter algorithm for selecting the smallest subset of features carrying all the information content of a data set (i.e. for removing redundant features). it is an advanced version of the fractal dimension reduction technique, and it relies on the recently introduced morisita estimator of intrinsic dimension (id). here, the id is used to quantify dependencies between subsets of features, which allows the effective processing of highly non-linear data. the proposed algorithm is successfully tested on simulated and real world case studies. different levels of sample size and noise are examined along with the variability of the results. in addition, a comprehensive procedure based on random forests shows that the data dimensionality is significantly reduced by the algorithm without loss of relevant information. and finally, comparisons with benchmark feature selection techniques demonstrate the promising performance of this new filter.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'data cleaning, whether manual or algorithmic, is rarely perfect leaving a dataset with an unknown number of false positives and false negatives after cleaning. in many scenarios, quantifying the number of remaining errors is challenging because our data integrity rules themselves may be incomplete, or the available gold-standard datasets may be too small to extrapolate. as the use of inherently fallible crowds becomes more prevalent in data cleaning problems, it is important to have estimators to quantify the extent of such errors. we propose novel species estimators to estimate the number of distinct remaining errors in a dataset after it has been cleaned by a set of crowd workers -- essentially, quantifying the utility of hiring additional workers to clean the dataset. this problem requires new estimators that are robust to false positives and false negatives, and we empirically show on three real-world datasets that existing species estimators are unstable for this problem, while our proposed techniques quickly converge.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'state-of-the-art algorithms for many semantic visual tasks are based on the use of convolutional neural networks. these networks are commonly trained, and evaluated, on large annotated datasets of artifact-free high-quality images. in this paper, we investigate the effect of one such artifact that is quite common in natural capture settings: optical blur. we show that standard network models, trained only on high-quality images, suffer a significant degradation in performance when applied to those degraded by blur due to defocus, or subject or camera motion. we investigate the extent to which this degradation is due to the mismatch between training and input image statistics. specifically, we find that fine-tuning a pre-trained model with blurred images added to the training set allows it to regain much of the lost accuracy. we also show that there is a fair amount of generalization between different degrees and types of blur, which implies that a single network model can be used robustly for recognition when the nature of the blur in the input is unknown. we find that this robustness arises as a result of these models learning to generate blur invariant representations in their hidden layers. our findings provide useful insights towards developing vision systems that can perform reliably on real world images affected by blur.',\n",

(ii) the robust averaging strategy, which is a means \\\\--- supported by psychology studies \\\\--- to integrating multiple/step-wise evidence to make a final perceptual judgment. (iii) the multi-task learning, which is believed to be an effectual means to shape representation learning and could result in a more generalized model.   to exploit the synergy of the three, we consider the nr-iqa as a dynamic perception process, in which the model samples a sequence of \"informative\" areas and aggregates the information to learn a representation for the tasks of jointly predicting the image quality score and the distortion type.   the model learning is implemented by a reinforcement strategy, in which the rewards of both tasks guide the learning of the optimal sampling policy to acquire the \"task-informative\" image regions so that the predictions can be made accurately and efficiently (in terms of the sampling steps). the reinforcement learning is realized by a deep network with the policy gradient method and trained through back-propagation.   in experiments, the model is tested on the tid2008 dataset and it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. furthermore, the model is very efficient in the sense that a small number of fixations are used in nr-iqa.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"a machine-learning-based framework for modeling the error introduced by surrogate models of parameterized dynamical systems is proposed. the framework entails the use of high-dimensional regression techniques (e.g., random forests, lasso) to map a large set of inexpensively computed `error indicators' (i.e., features) produced by the surrogate model at a given time instance to a prediction of the surrogate-model error in a quantity of interest (qoi). this eliminates the need for the user to hand-select a small number of informative features. the methodology requires a training set of parameter instances at which the time-dependent surrogate-model error is computed by simulating both the high-fidelity and surrogate models. using these training data, the method first determines regression-model locality (via classification or clustering), and subsequently constructs a `local' regression model to predict the time-instantaneous error within each identified region of feature space. we consider two uses for the resulting error model: (1) as a correction to the surrogate-model qoi prediction at each time instance, and (2) as a way to statistically model arbitrary functions of the time-dependent surrogate-model error (e.g., time-integrated errors). we apply the proposed framework to model errors in reduced-order models of nonlinear oil--water subsurface flow simulations. the reduced-order models used in this work entail application of trajectory piecewise linearization with proper orthogonal decomposition. when the first use of the method is considered, numerical experiments demonstrate consistent improvement in accuracy in the time-instantaneous qoi prediction relative to the original surrogate model, across a large number of test cases. when the second use is considered, results show that the proposed method provides accurate statistical predictions of the time- and well-averaged errors.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'how to preserve users\\' privacy while supporting high-utility analytics for low-latency stream processing? to answer this question: we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of privapprox, a data analytics system for privacy-preserving stream processing. privapprox provides three properties: (i) privacy: zero-knowledge privacy guarantees for users, a privacy bound tighter than the state-of-the-art differential privacy; (ii) utility: an interface for data analysts to systematically explore the trade-offs between the output accuracy (with error-estimation) and query execution budget; (iii) latency: near real-time stream processing based on a scalable \"synchronization-free\" distributed architecture. the key idea behind our approach is to marry two existing techniques together: namely, sampling (used in the context of approximate computing) and randomized response (used in the context of privacy-preserving analytics). the resulting marriage is complementary - it achieves stronger privacy guarantees and also improves performance, a necessary ingredient for achieving low-latency stream analytics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"increasing safety and automation in transportation systems has led to the proliferation of radar and ieee 802.11 dedicated short range communication (dsrc) in vehicles. current implementations of vehicular radar devices, however, are expensive, use a substantial amount of bandwidth, and are susceptible to multiple security risks. consider the feasibility of using an ieee 802.11 orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ofdm) communications waveform to perform radar functions. in this paper, we present an approach that determines the mean-normalized channel energy from frequency domain channel estimates and models it as a direct sinusoidal function of target range, enabling closest target range estimation. in addition, we propose an alternative to vehicular forward collision detection by extending ieee 802.11 dedicated short-range communications (dsrc) and wifi technology to radar, providing a foundation for joint communications and radar framework. furthermore, we perform an experimental demonstration using existing ieee 802.11 devices with minimal modification through algorithm processing on frequency-domain channel estimates. the results of this paper show that our solution delivers similar accuracy and reliability to mmwave radar devices with as little as 20 mhz of spectrum (doubling dsrc's 10 mhz allocation), indicating significant potential for industrial devices with joint vehicular communications and radar capabilities.\",\n",

(ii) we then consider the existence of widely used precomputed sorted lists. after discussing several approaches, and studying their limitations, we propose ta-sky, a novel threshold style algorithm that utilizes sorted lists. moreover, we further optimize ta-sky and explore its progressive nature, making it suitable for applications with strict interactive requirements. in addition to the extensive theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithms, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the combination of real (including the entire airbnb data collection) and synthetic datasets to study the practicality of the proposed algorithms. the results showcase the superior performance of our techniques, outperforming applicable approaches by orders of magnitude.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"the inverse relationship between the length of a word and the frequency of its use, first identified by g.k. zipf in 1935, is a classic empirical law that holds across a wide range of human languages. we demonstrate that length is one aspect of a much more general property of words: how distinctive they are with respect to other words in a language. distinctiveness plays a critical role in recognizing words in fluent speech, in that it reflects the strength of potential competitors when selecting the best candidate for an ambiguous signal. phonological information content, a measure of a word's string probability under a statistical model of a language's sound or character sequences, concisely captures distinctiveness. examining large-scale corpora from 13 languages, we find that distinctiveness significantly outperforms word length as a predictor of frequency. this finding provides evidence that listeners' processing constraints shape fine-grained aspects of word forms across languages.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"crowdsourcing mobile user's network performance has become an effective way of understanding and improving mobile network performance and user quality-of-experience. however, the current measurement method is still based on the landline measurement paradigm in which a measurement app measures the path to fixed (measurement or web) servers. in this work, we introduce a new paradigm of measuring per-app mobile network performance. we design and implement mopeye, an android app to measure network round-trip delay for each app whenever there is app traffic. this opportunistic measurement can be conducted automatically without users intervention. therefore, it can facilitate a large-scale and long-term crowdsourcing of mobile network performance. in the course of implementing mopeye, we have overcome a suite of challenges to make the continuous latency monitoring lightweight and accurate. we have deployed mopeye to google play for an irb-approved crowdsourcing study in a period of ten months, which obtains over five million measurements from 6,266 android apps on 2,351 smartphones. the analysis reveals a number of new findings on the per-app network performance and mobile dns performance.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'learning to rank has recently emerged as an attractive technique to train deep convolutional neural networks for various computer vision tasks. pairwise ranking, in particular, has been successful in multi-label image classification, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. however, most existing approaches use the hinge loss to train their models, which is non-smooth and thus is difficult to optimize especially with deep networks. furthermore, they employ simple heuristics, such as top-k or thresholding, to determine which labels to include in the output from a ranked list of labels, which limits their use in the real-world setting. in this work, we propose two techniques to improve pairwise ranking based multi-label image classification: (1) we propose a novel loss function for pairwise ranking, which is smooth everywhere and thus is easier to optimize; and (2) we incorporate a label decision module into the model, estimating the optimal confidence thresholds for each visual concept. we provide theoretical analyses of our loss function in the bayes consistency and risk minimization framework, and show its benefit over existing pairwise ranking formulations. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three large-scale datasets, voc2007, nus-wide and ms-coco, achieving the best reported results in the literature.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'we study an extension of active learning in which the learning algorithm may ask the annotator to compare the distances of two examples from the boundary of their label-class. for example, in a recommendation system application (say for restaurants), the annotator may be asked whether she liked or disliked a specific restaurant (a label query); or which one of two restaurants did she like more (a comparison query).   we focus on the class of half spaces, and show that under natural assumptions, such as large margin or bounded bit-description of the input examples, it is possible to reveal all the labels of a sample of size $n$ using approximately $o(\\\\log n)$ queries. this implies an exponential improvement over classical active learning, where only label queries are allowed. we complement these results by showing that if any of these assumptions is removed then, in the worst case, $\\\\omega(n)$ queries are required.   our results follow from a new general framework of active learning with additional queries. we identify a combinatorial dimension, called the \\\\emph{inference dimension}, that captures the query complexity when each additional query is determined by $o(1)$ examples (such as comparison queries, each of which is determined by the two compared examples). our results for half spaces follow by bounding the inference dimension in the cases discussed above.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'we propose a new technique for visual attribute transfer across images that may have very different appearance but have perceptually similar semantic structure. by visual attribute transfer, we mean transfer of visual information (such as color, tone, texture, and style) from one image to another. for example, one image could be that of a painting or a sketch while the other is a photo of a real scene, and both depict the same type of scene.   our technique finds semantically-meaningful dense correspondences between two input images. to accomplish this, it adapts the notion of \"image analogy\" with features extracted from a deep convolutional neutral network for matching; we call our technique deep image analogy. a coarse-to-fine strategy is used to compute the nearest-neighbor field for generating the results. we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method in a variety of cases, including style/texture transfer, color/style swap, sketch/painting to photo, and time lapse.',\n",

[1] in most cases, angiograms are manually analyzed by a cardiologist. actually, there are no clinical practice algorithms which could improve and automate this work. neural networks show high efficiency in tasks of image analysis and they can be used for the analysis of angiograms and facilitate diagnostics. we have developed an algorithm based on convolutional neural network and neural network u-net [2] for vessels segmentation and defects detection such as stenosis. for our research we used anonymized angiography data obtained from one of the city's hospitals and augmented them to improve learning efficiency. u-net usage provided high quality segmentation and the combination of our algorithm with an ensemble of classifiers shows a good accuracy in the task of ischemia evaluation on test data. subsequently, this approach can be served as a basis for the creation of an analytical system that could speed up the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and greatly facilitate the work of a specialist.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'nash equilibrium is a popular solution concept for solving imperfect-information games in practice. however, it has a major drawback: it does not preclude suboptimal play in branches of the game tree that are not reached in equilibrium. equilibrium refinements can mend this issue, but have experienced little practical adoption. this is largely due to a lack of scalable algorithms.   sparse iterative methods, in particular first-order methods, are known to be among the most effective algorithms for computing nash equilibria in large-scale two-player zero-sum extensive-form games. in this paper, we provide, to our knowledge, the first extension of these methods to equilibrium refinements. we develop a smoothing approach for behavioral perturbations of the convex polytope that encompasses the strategy spaces of players in an extensive-form game. this enables one to compute an approximate variant of extensive-form perfect equilibria. experiments show that our smoothing approach leads to solutions with dramatically stronger strategies at information sets that are reached with low probability in approximate nash equilibria, while retaining the overall convergence rate associated with fast algorithms for nash equilibrium. this has benefits both in approximate equilibrium finding (such approximation is necessary in practice in large games) where some probabilities are low while possibly heading toward zero in the limit, and exact equilibrium computation where the low probabilities are actually zero.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"this paper considers a traditional problem of resource allocation, scheduling jobs on machines. one such recent application is cloud computing, where jobs arrive in an online fashion with capacity requirements and need to be immediately scheduled on physical machines in data centers. it is often observed that the requested capacities are not fully utilized, hence offering an opportunity to employ an overcommitment policy, i.e., selling resources beyond capacity. setting the right overcommitment level can induce a significant cost reduction for the cloud provider, while only inducing a very low risk of violating capacity constraints. we introduce and study a model that quantifies the value of overcommitment by modeling the problem as a bin packing with chance constraints. we then propose an alternative formulation that transforms each chance constraint into a submodular function. we show that our model captures the risk pooling effect and can guide scheduling and overcommitment decisions. we also develop a family of online algorithms that are intuitive, easy to implement and provide a constant factor guarantee from optimal. finally, we calibrate our model using realistic workload data, and test our approach in a practical setting. our analysis and experiments illustrate the benefit of overcommitment in cloud services, and suggest a cost reduction of 1.5% to 17% depending on the provider's risk tolerance.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"online music services are increasing in popularity. they enable us to analyze people's music listening behavior based on play logs. although it is known that people listen to music based on topic (e.g., rock or jazz), we assume that when a user is addicted to an artist, s/he chooses the artist's songs regardless of topic. based on this assumption, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to analyze people's music listening behavior. our main contributions are three-fold. first, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study modeling music listening behavior by taking into account the influence of addiction to artists. second, by using real-world datasets of play logs, we showed the effectiveness of our proposed model. third, we carried out qualitative experiments and showed that taking addiction into account enables us to analyze music listening behavior from a new viewpoint in terms of how people listen to music according to the time of day, how an artist's songs are listened to by people, etc. we also discuss the possibility of applying the analysis results to applications such as artist similarity computation and song recommendation.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"with the advent of autonomous vehicles, lidar and cameras have become an indispensable combination of sensors. they both provide rich and complementary data which can be used by various algorithms and machine learning to sense and make vital inferences about the surroundings. we propose a novel pipeline and experimental setup to find accurate rigid-body transformation for extrinsically calibrating a lidar and a camera. the pipeling uses 3d-3d point correspondences in lidar and camera frame and gives a closed form solution. we further show the accuracy of the estimate by fusing point clouds from two stereo cameras which align perfectly with the rotation and translation estimated by our method, confirming the accuracy of our method's estimates both mathematically and visually. taking our idea of extrinsic lidar-camera calibration forward, we demonstrate how two cameras with no overlapping field-of-view can also be calibrated extrinsically using 3d point correspondences. the code has been made available as open-source software in the form of a ros package, more information about which can be sought here: https://github.com/ankitdhall/lidar_camera_calibration .\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'massive deployment of low data rate internet of things and ehealth devices prompts us to develop more practical precoding and user selection techniques that comply with these requirements. moreover, it is known that when the data is real-valued and the observation is complex-valued, widely linear (wl) estimation can be employed in lieu of linear estimation to improve the performance. with these motivations, in this paper, we study the transmit precoding (beamforming) in multiuser multiple-input single-output communications systems assuming the transmit signal is one-dimensionally modulated and widely linear estimation is performed at the receivers. closed-form solutions for widely linear maximum ratio transmission (mrt), wl zero-forcing (zf), wl minimum mean square error (mmse), and wl maximum signal to leakage and noise ratio (mslnr) precoding are obtained. it is shown that widely linear processing can potentially double the number of simultaneous users compared to the linear processing of one-dimensionally modulated signals. furthermore, to deal with the increasing number of communications devices a user selection algorithm compatible with widely linear processing of one-dimensionally modulated signals is proposed. the proposed user selection algorithm can double the number of simultaneously selected users compared to conventional user selection methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'an overarching issue in resource management of wireless networks is assessing their capacity: how much communication can be achieved in a network, utilizing all the tools available: power control, scheduling, routing, channel assignment and rate adjustment? we propose the first framework for approximation algorithms in the physical model that addresses these questions in full, including rate control. the approximations obtained are doubly logarithmic in the link length and rate diversity. where previous bounds are known, this gives an exponential improvement.   a key contribution is showing that the complex interference relationship of the physical model can be simplified into a novel type of amenable conflict graphs, at a small cost. we also show that the approximation obtained is provably the best possible for any conflict graph formulation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the energy consumption of dram is a critical concern in modern computing systems. improvements in manufacturing process technology have allowed dram vendors to lower the dram supply voltage conservatively, which reduces some of the dram energy consumption. we would like to reduce the dram supply voltage more aggressively, to further reduce energy. aggressive supply voltage reduction requires a thorough understanding of the effect voltage scaling has on dram access latency and dram reliability.   in this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to understanding and exploiting the latency and reliability characteristics of modern dram when the supply voltage is lowered below the nominal voltage level specified by dram standards. using an fpga-based testing platform, we perform an experimental study of 124 real ddr3l (low-voltage) dram chips manufactured recently by three major dram vendors. we find that reducing the supply voltage below a certain point introduces bit errors in the data, and we comprehensively characterize the behavior of these errors. we discover that these errors can be avoided by increasing the latency of three major dram operations (activation, restoration, and precharge). we perform detailed dram circuit simulations to validate and explain our experimental findings. we also characterize the various relationships between reduced supply voltage and error locations, stored data patterns, dram temperature, and data retention.   based on our observations, we propose a new dram energy reduction mechanism, called voltron. the key idea of voltron is to use a performance model to determine by how much we can reduce the supply voltage without introducing errors and without exceeding a user-specified threshold for performance loss. voltron reduces the average system energy by 7.3% while limiting the average system performance loss to only 1.8%, for a variety of workloads.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'we pursue a study of the generalized demand matching problem, a common generalization of the $b$-matching and knapsack problems. here, we are given a graph with vertex capacities, edge profits, and asymmetric demands on the edges. the goal is to find a maximum-profit subset of edges so the demands of chosen edges do not violate vertex capacities. this problem is apx-hard and constant-factor approximations are known.   our results fall into two categories. first, using iterated relaxation and various filtering strategies, we show with an efficient rounding algorithm if an additional matroid structure $\\\\mathcal m$ is given and we further only allow sets $f \\\\subseteq e$ that are independent in $\\\\mathcal m$, the natural lp relaxation has an integrality gap of at most $\\\\frac{25}{3} \\\\approx 8.333$. this can be improved in various special cases, for example we improve over the 15-approximation for the previously-studied coupled placement problem [korupolu et al. 2014] by giving a $7$-approximation.   using similar techniques, we show the problem of computing a minimum-cost base in $\\\\mathcal m$ satisfying vertex capacities admits a $(1,3)$-bicriteria approximation. this improves over the previous $(1,4)$-approximation in the special case that $\\\\mathcal m$ is the graphic matroid over the given graph [fukanaga and nagamochi, 2009].   second, we show demand matching admits a polynomial-time approximation scheme in graphs that exclude a fixed minor. if all demands are polynomially-bounded integers, this is somewhat easy using dynamic programming in bounded-treewidth graphs. our main technical contribution is a sparsification lemma allowing us to scale the demands to be used in a more intricate dynamic programming algorithm, followed by randomized rounding to filter our scaled-demand solution to a feasible solution.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"models of the cortico-basal ganglia network and volume conductor models of the brain can provide insight into the mechanisms of action of deep brain stimulation (dbs). in this study, the coupling of a network model, under parkinsonian conditions, to the extracellular field distribution obtained from a three dimensional finite element model of a rodent's brain during dbs is presented. this coupled model is used to investigate the influence of uncertainty in the electrical properties of brain tissue and encapsulation tissue, formed around the electrode after implantation, on the suppression of oscillatory neural activity during dbs. the resulting uncertainty in this effect of dbs on the network activity is quantified using a computationally efficient and non-intrusive stochastic approach based on the generalized polynomial chaos. the results suggest that variations in the electrical properties of brain tissue may have a substantial influence on the level of suppression of oscillatory activity during dbs. applying a global sensitivity analysis on the suppression of the simulated oscillatory activity showed that the influence of uncertainty in the electrical properties of the encapsulation tissue had only a minor influence, in agreement with previous experimental and computational studies investigating the mechanisms of current-controlled dbs in the literature.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this paper, we propose the classification method based on a learning paradigm we are going to call quantum low entropy based associative reasoning or qlear learning. the approach is based on the idea that classification can be understood as supervised clustering, where a quantum entropy in the context of the quantum probabilistic model, will be used as a \"capturer\" (measure, or external index), of the \"natural structure\" of the data. by using quantum entropy we do not make any assumption about linear separability of the data that are going to be classified. the basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and then use relative change in the quantum entropy as a measure of similarity of the newly arrived sample with the representatives of interest. in other words, method is based on calculation of quantum entropy of the referent system and its relative change with the addition of the newly arrived sample. referent system consists of vectors that represent individual classes and that are the most similar, in euclidean distance sense, to the vector that is analyzed. here, we analyze the classification problem in the context of measuring similarities to prototype examples of categories. while nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. alternatively, one could use machine learning techniques (like support vector machines) but they involve time-consuming optimization. here we propose a hybrid of nearest neighbor and machine learning technique which deals naturally with the multi-class setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'this paper proposes a new approach to a novel value network architecture for the game go, called a multi-labelled (ml) value network. in the ml value network, different values (win rates) are trained simultaneously for different settings of komi, a compensation given to balance the initiative of playing first. the ml value network has three advantages, (a) it outputs values for different komi, (b) it supports dynamic komi, and (c) it lowers the mean squared error (mse). this paper also proposes a new dynamic komi method to improve game-playing strength. this paper also performs experiments to demonstrate the merits of the architecture. first, the mse of the ml value network is generally lower than the value network alone. second, the program based on the ml value network wins by a rate of 67.6% against the program based on the value network alone. third, the program with the proposed dynamic komi method significantly improves the playing strength over the baseline that does not use dynamic komi, especially for handicap games. to our knowledge, up to date, no handicap games have been played openly by programs using value networks. this paper provides these programs with a useful approach to playing handicap games.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'clause learning is one of the most important components of a conflict driven clause learning (cdcl) sat solver that is effective on industrial instances. since the number of learned clauses is proved to be exponential in the worse case, it is necessary to identify the most relevant clauses to maintain and delete the irrelevant ones. as reported in the literature, several learned clauses deletion strategies have been proposed. however the diversity in both the number of clauses to be removed at each step of reduction and the results obtained with each strategy creates confusion to determine which criterion is better. thus, the problem to select which learned clauses are to be removed during the search step remains very challenging. in this paper, we propose a novel approach to identify the most relevant learned clauses without favoring or excluding any of the proposed measures, but by adopting the notion of dominance relationship among those measures. our approach bypasses the problem of the diversity of results and reaches a compromise between the assessments of these measures. furthermore, the proposed approach also avoids another non-trivial problem which is the amount of clauses to be deleted at each reduction of the learned clause database.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'partially observable environments present an important open challenge in the domain of sequential control learning with delayed rewards. despite numerous attempts during the two last decades, the majority of reinforcement learning algorithms and associated approximate models, applied to this context, still assume markovian state transitions. in this paper, we explore the use of a recently proposed attention-based model, the gated end-to-end memory network, for sequential control. we call the resulting model the gated end-to-end memory policy network. more precisely, we use a model-free value-based algorithm to learn policies for partially observed domains using this memory-enhanced neural network. this model is end-to-end learnable and it features unbounded memory. indeed, because of its attention mechanism and associated non-parametric memory, the proposed model allows us to define an attention mechanism over the observation stream unlike recurrent models. we show encouraging results that illustrate the capability of our attention-based model in the context of the continuous-state non-stationary control problem of stock trading. we also present an openai gym environment for simulated stock exchange and explain its relevance as a benchmark for the field of non-markovian decision process learning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"we consider the online one-class collaborative filtering (cf) problem that consists of recommending items to users over time in an online fashion based on positive ratings only. this problem arises when users respond only occasionally to a recommendation with a positive rating, and never with a negative one. we study the impact of the probability of a user responding to a recommendation, p_f, on the sample complexity, i.e., the number of ratings required to make `good' recommendations, and ask whether receiving positive and negative ratings, instead of positive ratings only, improves the sample complexity. both questions arise in the design of recommender systems. we introduce a simple probabilistic user model, and analyze the performance of an online user-based cf algorithm. we prove that after an initial cold start phase, where recommendations are invested in exploring the user's preferences, this algorithm makes---up to a fraction of the recommendations required for updating the user's preferences---perfect recommendations. the number of ratings required for the cold start phase is nearly proportional to 1/p_f, and that for updating the user's preferences is essentially independent of p_f. as a consequence we find that, receiving positive and negative ratings instead of only positive ones improves the number of ratings required for initial exploration by a factor of 1/p_f, which can be significant.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"tumor growth prediction, a highly challenging task, has long been viewed as a mathematical modeling problem, where the tumor growth pattern is personalized based on imaging and clinical data of a target patient. though mathematical models yield promising results, their prediction accuracy may be limited by the absence of population trend data and personalized clinical characteristics. in this paper, we propose a statistical group learning approach to predict the tumor growth pattern that incorporates both the population trend and personalized data, in order to discover high-level features from multimodal imaging data. a deep convolutional neural network approach is developed to model the voxel-wise spatio-temporal tumor progression. the deep features are combined with the time intervals and the clinical factors to feed a process of feature selection. our predictive model is pretrained on a group data set and personalized on the target patient data to estimate the future spatio-temporal progression of the patient's tumor. multimodal imaging data at multiple time points are used in the learning, personalization and inference stages. our method achieves a dice coefficient of 86.8% +- 3.6% and rvd of 7.9% +- 5.4% on a pancreatic tumor data set, outperforming the dsc of 84.4% +- 4.0% and rvd 13.9% +- 9.8% obtained by a previous state-of-the-art model-based method.\",\n",

(b) if ride-sharing utilization is dynamic, can it be correlated with some traceable features of the traffic? and (c) if ride-sharing utilization is dynamic, can it be predicted ahead of time? we analyze a dataset of over 14 million taxi trips taken in new york city. we propose a dynamic travel network approach for modeling and forecasting the potential ride-sharing utilization over time, showing it to be highly volatile. in order to model the utilization's dynamics we propose a network-centric approach, projecting the aggregated traffic taken from continuous time periods into a feature space comprised of topological features of the network implied by this traffic. this feature space is then used to model the dynamics of ride-sharing utilization over time. the results of our analysis demonstrate the significant volatility of ride-sharing utilization over time, indicating that any policy, design or plan that would disregard this aspect and chose a static paradigm would undoubtably be either highly inefficient or provide insufficient resources. we show that using our suggested approach it is possible to model the potential utilization of ride sharing based on the topological properties of the rides network. we also show that using this method the potential utilization can be forecasting a few hours ahead of time.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'existing methods for dealing with knowledge updates differ greatly depending on the underlying knowledge representation formalism. when classical logic is used, updates are typically performed by manipulating the knowledge base on the model-theoretic level. on the opposite side of the spectrum stand the semantics for updating answer-set programs that need to rely on rule syntax. yet, a unifying perspective that could embrace both these branches of research is of great importance as it enables a deeper understanding of all involved methods and principles and creates room for their cross-fertilisation, ripening and further development.   this paper bridges the seemingly irreconcilable approaches to updates. it introduces a novel monotonic characterisation of rules, dubbed re-models, and shows it to be a more suitable semantic foundation for rule updates than se-models. then it proposes a generic scheme for specifying semantic rule update operators, based on the idea of viewing a program as the set of sets of re-models of its rules; updates are performed by introducing additional interpretations - exceptions - to the sets of re-models of rules in the original program. the introduced scheme is used to define rule update operators that are closely related to both classical update principles and traditional approaches to rules updates, and serve as a basis for a solution to the long-standing problem of state condensing, showing how they can be equivalently defined as binary operators on some class of logic programs.   finally, the essence of these ideas is extracted to define an abstract framework for exception-based update operators, viewing a knowledge base as the set of sets of models of its elements, which can capture a wide range of both model- and formula-based classical update operators, and thus serves as the first firm formal ground connecting classical and rule updates.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'cardiovascular disease (cvd) is the leading cause of mortality yet largely preventable, but the key to prevention is to identify at-risk individuals before adverse events. for predicting individual cvd risk, carotid intima-media thickness (cimt), a noninvasive ultrasound method, has proven to be valuable, offering several advantages over ct coronary artery calcium score. however, each cimt examination includes several ultrasound videos, and interpreting each of these cimt videos involves three operations: (1) select three end-diastolic ultrasound frames (euf) in the video, (2) localize a region of interest (roi) in each selected frame, and (3) trace the lumen-intima interface and the media-adventitia interface in each roi to measure cimt. these operations are tedious, laborious, and time consuming, a serious limitation that hinders the widespread utilization of cimt in clinical practice. to overcome this limitation, this paper presents a new system to automate cimt video interpretation. our extensive experiments demonstrate that the suggested system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. the superior performance is attributable to our unified framework based on convolutional neural networks (cnns) coupled with our informative image representation and effective post-processing of the cnn outputs, which are uniquely designed for each of the above three operations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the security-constrained economic dispatch (sced) problem tries to maintain the reliability of a power network by ensuring that a single failure does not lead to a global outage. the previous research has mainly investigated sced by formulating the problem in different modalities, e.g. preventive or corrective, and devising efficient solutions for sced. in this paper, we tackle a novel and important direction, and analyze the economic cost of incorporating security constraints in economic dispatch. inspired by existing inefficiency metrics in game theory and computer science, we introduce notion of price of security as a metric that formally characterizes the economic inefficiency of security-constrained economic dispatch as compared to the original problem without security constraints. then, we focus on the preventive approach in a simple topology comprising two buses and two lines, and investigate the impact of generation availability and demand distribution on the price of security. moreover, we explicitly derive the worst-case input instance that leads to the maximum price of security. by extensive experimental study on two test-cases, we verify the analytical results and provide insights for characterizing the price of security in general networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'a novel skill learning approach is proposed that allows a robot to acquire human-like visuospatial skills for object manipulation tasks. visuospatial skills are attained by observing spatial relationships among objects through demonstrations. the proposed visuospatial skill learning (vsl) is a goal-based approach that focuses on achieving a desired goal configuration of objects relative to one another while maintaining the sequence of operations. vsl is capable of learning and generalizing multi-operation skills from a single demonstration, while requiring minimum prior knowledge about the objects and the environment. in contrast to many existing approaches, vsl offers simplicity, efficiency and user-friendly human-robot interaction. we also show that vsl can be easily extended towards 3d object manipulation tasks, simply by employing point cloud processing techniques. in addition, a robot learning framework, vsl-sp, is proposed by integrating vsl, imitation learning, and a conventional planning method. in vsl-sp, the sequence of performed actions are learned using vsl, while the sensorimotor skills are learned using a conventional trajectory-based learning approach. such integration easily extends robot capabilities to novel situations, even by users without programming ability. in vsl-sp the internal planner of vsl is integrated with an existing action-level symbolic planner. using the underlying constraints of the task and extracted symbolic predicates, identified by vsl, symbolic representation of the task is updated. therefore the planner maintains a generalized representation of each skill as a reusable action, which can be used in planning and performed independently during the learning phase. the proposed approach is validated through several real-world experiments.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"rank and select are fundamental operations in succinct data structures, that is, data structures whose space consumption approaches the information-theoretic optimal. the performance of these primitives is central to the overall performance of succinct data structures.   traditionally, the select operation is the harder to implement efficiently, and most prior implementations of select on machine words use 50--80 machine instructions. (in contrast, rank on machine words can be implemented in only a handful of instructions on machines that support popcount.) however, recently pandey et al. gave a new implementation of machine-word select that uses only four x86 machine instructions; two of which were introduced in intel's haswell cpus.   in this paper, we investigate the impact of this new implementation of machine-word select on the performance of general bit-vector-select. we first compare pandey et al.'s machine-word select to the state-of-the-art implementations of zhou et al. (which is not specific to haswell) and gog et al. (which uses some haswell-specific instructions). we exhibit a speedup of 2x to 4x.   we then study the impact of plugging pandey et al.'s machine-word select into two state-of-the-art bit-vector-select implementations. both zhou et al.'s and gog et al.'s select implementations perform a single machine-word select operation for each bit-vector select. we replaced the machine-word select with the new implementation and compared performance. even though there is only a single machine- word select operation, we still obtained speedups of 20% to 68%. we found that the new select not only reduced the number of instructions required for each bit-vector select, but also improved cpu instruction cache performance and memory-access parallelism.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"logistic regression is used thousands of times a day to fit data, predict future outcomes, and assess the statistical significance of explanatory variables. when used for the purpose of statistical inference, logistic models produce p-values for the regression coefficients by using an approximation to the distribution of the likelihood-ratio test. indeed, wilks' theorem asserts that whenever we have a fixed number $p$ of variables, twice the log-likelihood ratio (llr) $2\\\\lambda$ is distributed as a $\\\\chi^2_k$ variable in the limit of large sample sizes $n$; here, $k$ is the number of variables being tested. in this paper, we prove that when $p$ is not negligible compared to $n$, wilks' theorem does not hold and that the chi-square approximation is grossly incorrect; in fact, this approximation produces p-values that are far too small (under the null hypothesis). assume that $n$ and $p$ grow large in such a way that $p/n\\\\rightarrow\\\\kappa$ for some constant $\\\\kappa < 1/2$. we prove that for a class of logistic models, the llr converges to a rescaled chi-square, namely, $2\\\\lambda~\\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\rightarrow}~\\\\alpha(\\\\kappa)\\\\chi_k^2$, where the scaling factor $\\\\alpha(\\\\kappa)$ is greater than one as soon as the dimensionality ratio $\\\\kappa$ is positive. hence, the llr is larger than classically assumed. for instance, when $\\\\kappa=0.3$, $\\\\alpha(\\\\kappa)\\\\approx1.5$. in general, we show how to compute the scaling factor by solving a nonlinear system of two equations with two unknowns. our mathematical arguments are involved and use techniques from approximate message passing theory, non-asymptotic random matrix theory and convex geometry. we also complement our mathematical study by showing that the new limiting distribution is accurate for finite sample sizes. finally, all the results from this paper extend to some other regression models such as the probit regression model.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'this paper proposes a new methodology to design optimal antennas for mimo (multi-input multi-output) communication systems by using spherical mode expansion. given spatial channel properties of a mimo channel, such as the angular profile at both sides, the optimal mimo antennas should provide the largest channel capacity with a constraint of the limited implementation space (volume). in designing a conventional mimo antenna, first the antenna structure (current distribution) is determined, second antenna directivity is calculated based on the current distribution, and thirdly mimo channel capacity is calculated by using given angular profiles and obtained antenna directivity. this process is repeated by adjusting the antenna structure until the performance satisfies a predefined threshold. to the contrary, this paper solves the optimization problem analytically and finally gives near optimal antenna structure (current distribution) without any greedy search. in the proposed process, first the optimal directivity of mimo antennas is derived by applying spherical mode expansion to the angular profiles, and second a far-near field conversion is applied on the derived optimal directivity to achieve near optimal current distributions on a limited surface. the effectiveness of the proposed design methodology is validated via numerical calculation of mimo channel capacity as in the conventional design method while giving near optimal current distribution with constraint of an antenna structure derived from proposed methodology.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'volume calculation from the computed tomography (ct) lung lesions data is a significant parameter for clinical diagnosis. the volume is widely used to assess the severity of the lung nodules and track its progression, however, the accuracy and efficiency of previous studies are not well achieved for clinical uses. it remains to be a challenging task due to its tight attachment to the lung wall, inhomogeneous background noises and large variations in sizes and shape. in this paper, we employ halton low-discrepancy sequences to calculate the volume of the lung lesions. the proposed method directly compute the volume without the procedure of three-dimension (3d) model reconstruction and surface triangulation, which significantly improves the efficiency and reduces the complexity. the main steps of the proposed method are: (1) generate a certain number of random points in each slice using halton low-discrepancy sequences and calculate the lesion area of each slice through the proportion; (2) obtain the volume by integrating the areas in the sagittal direction. in order to evaluate our proposed method, the experiments were conducted on the sufficient data sets with different size of lung lesions. with the uniform distribution of random points, our proposed method achieves more accurate results compared with other methods, which demonstrates the robustness and accuracy for the volume calculation of ct lung lesions. in addition, our proposed method is easy to follow and can be extensively applied to other applications, e.g., volume calculation of liver tumor, atrial wall aneurysm, etc.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this paper, we propose the first homomorphic based proxy re-encryption (hpre) solution that allows different users to share data they outsourced homomorphically encrypted using their respective public keys with the possibility to process such data remotely. more clearly, this scheme makes possible to switch the public encryption key to another one without the help of a trusted third party. its originality stands on a method we propose so as to compute the difference between two encrypted data without decrypting them and with no extra communications. basically, in our hpre scheme, the two users, the delegator and the delegate, ask the cloud server to generate an encrypted noise based on a secret key, both users previously agreed on. based on our solution for comparing encrypted data, the cloud computes in clear the differences in-between the encrypted noise and the encrypted data of the delegator, obtaining thus blinded data. by next the cloud encrypts these differences with the public key of the delegate. as the noise is also known of the delegate, this one just has to remove it to get access to the data encrypted with his public key. this solution has been experimented in the case of the sharing of images outsourced into a semihonest cloud server.',\n",
