580,2210.13383,evaluating long-term memory in 3d mazes,cs.ai cs.lg,"intelligent agents need to remember salient information to reason in partially-observed environments. for example, agents with a first-person view should remember the positions of relevant objects even if they go out of view. similarly, to effectively navigate through rooms agents need to remember the floor plan of how rooms are connected. however, most benchmark tasks in reinforcement learning do not test long-term memory in agents, slowing down progress in this important research direction. in this paper, we introduce the memory maze, a 3d domain of randomized mazes specifically designed for evaluating long-term memory in agents. unlike existing benchmarks, memory maze measures long-term memory separate from confounding agent abilities and requires the agent to localize itself by integrating information over time. with memory maze, we propose an online reinforcement learning benchmark, a diverse offline dataset, and an offline probing evaluation. recording a human player establishes a strong baseline and verifies the need to build up and retain memories, which is reflected in their gradually increasing rewards within each episode. we find that current algorithms benefit from training with truncated backpropagation through time and succeed on small mazes, but fall short of human performance on the large mazes, leaving room for future algorithmic designs to be evaluated on the memory maze.",,2022-10-24,,"['jurgis pasukonis', 'timothy lillicrap', 'danijar hafner']"
581,2210.13390,on the failure of variational score matching for vae models,stat.ml cs.lg,"score matching (sm) is a convenient method for training flexible probabilistic models, which is often preferred over the traditional maximum-likelihood (ml) approach. however, these models are less interpretable than normalized models; as such, training robustness is in general difficult to assess. we present a critical study of existing variational sm objectives, showing catastrophic failure on a wide range of datasets and network architectures. our theoretical insights on the objectives emerge directly from their equivalent autoencoding losses when optimizing variational autoencoder (vae) models. first, we show that in the fisher autoencoder, sm produces far worse models than maximum-likelihood, and approximate inference by fisher divergence can lead to low-density local optima. however, with important modifications, this objective reduces to a regularized autoencoding loss that resembles the evidence lower bound (elbo). this analysis predicts that the modified sm algorithm should behave very similarly to elbo on gaussian vaes. we then review two other fd-based objectives from the literature and show that they reduce to uninterpretable autoencoding losses, likely leading to poor performance. the experiments verify our theoretical predictions and suggest that only elbo and the baseline objective robustly produce expected results, while previously proposed sm methods do not.",,2022-10-24,,['li kevin wenliang']

588,2210.13435,dichotomy of control: separating what you can control from what you   cannot,cs.lg,"future- or return-conditioned supervised learning is an emerging paradigm for offline reinforcement learning (rl), where the future outcome (i.e., return) associated with an observed action sequence is used as input to a policy trained to imitate those same actions. while return-conditioning is at the heart of popular algorithms such as decision transformer (dt), these methods tend to perform poorly in highly stochastic environments, where an occasional high return can arise from randomness in the environment rather than the actions themselves. such situations can lead to a learned policy that is inconsistent with its conditioning inputs; i.e., using the policy to act in the environment, when conditioning on a specific desired return, leads to a distribution of real returns that is wildly different than desired. in this work, we propose the dichotomy of control (doc), a future-conditioned supervised learning framework that separates mechanisms within a policy's control (actions) from those beyond a policy's control (environment stochasticity). we achieve this separation by conditioning the policy on a latent variable representation of the future, and designing a mutual information constraint that removes any information from the latent variable associated with randomness in the environment. theoretically, we show that doc yields policies that are consistent with their conditioning inputs, ensuring that conditioning a learned policy on a desired high-return future outcome will correctly induce high-return behavior. empirically, we show that doc is able to achieve significantly better performance than dt on environments that have highly stochastic rewards and transition",,2022-10-24,,"['mengjiao yang', 'dale schuurmans', 'pieter abbeel', 'ofir nachum']"

(2) metaformer works well with arbitrary token mixers. when specifying the token mixer as even a random matrix to mix tokens, the resulting model randformer yields an accuracy of >81%, outperforming identityformer. rest assured of metaformer's results when new token mixers are adopted. (3) metaformer effortlessly offers state-of-the-art results. with just conventional token mixers dated back five years ago, the models instantiated from metaformer already beat state of the art. (a) convformer outperforms convnext. taking the common depthwise separable convolutions as the token mixer, the model termed convformer, which can be regarded as pure cnns, outperforms the strong cnn model convnext. (b) caformer sets new record on imagenet-1k. by simply applying depthwise separable convolutions as token mixer in the bottom stages and vanilla self-attention in the top stages, the resulting model caformer sets a new record on imagenet-1k: it achieves an accuracy of 85.5% at 224x224 resolution, under normal supervised training without external data or distillation. in our expedition to probe metaformer, we also find that a new activation, starrelu, reduces 71% flops of activation compared with gelu yet achieves better performance. we expect starrelu to find great potential in metaformer-like models alongside other neural networks.",,2022-10-24,,"['weihao yu', 'chenyang si', 'pan zhou', 'mi luo', 'yichen zhou', 'jiashi feng', 'shuicheng yan', 'xinchao wang']"
