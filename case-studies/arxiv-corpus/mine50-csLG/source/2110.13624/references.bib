@article{Luo2019,
   abstract = {A strand of recent studies utilized complete patent databases and classification systems to construct large network maps of patent technology classes, which might approximate the total technology space. It has been argued that such maps are useful for competitive intelligence analysis, technology road mapping, innovation decision support, and so on in the literature. In this paper, we illustrate the InnoGPS system to integrate such a map with various map-based visual analytic functions for technology navigation, positioning, neighborhood exploration, path finding and information retrieval. These analytics are either descriptive, predictive or prescriptive. During the process of developing InnoGPS, we have conceived a wide spectrum of other potential applications of the total technology space map for consumers, business, education and so on. These possibilities together with the difficulty to construct an accurate technology space representation suggest the strategic value to develop the total technology space map as a digital platform for any applications to discover, manage or represent any data, information and knowledge related to technologies, and to nurture an ecosystem of developers and users.},

   abstract = {Technological progress builds upon itself, with the expansion of invention in one domain propelling future work in linked fields. Our analysis uses 1.8 million US patents and their citation properties to map the innovation network and its strength. Past innovation network structures are calculated using citation patterns across technology classes during 1975-1994. The interaction of this preexisting network structure with patent growth in upstream technology fields has strong predictive power on future innovation after 1995. This pattern is consistent with the idea that when there is more past upstream innovation for a particular technology class to build on, then that technology class innovates more.},

   abstract = {Design-by-analogy (DbA) is a design methodology wherein new solutions, opportunities, or designs are generated in a target domain based on inspiration drawn from a source domain; it can benefit designers in mitigating design fixation and improving design ideation outcomes. Recently, the increasingly available design databases and rapidly advancing data science and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have presented new opportunities for developing data-driven methods and tools for DbA support. In this study, we survey existing data-driven DbA studies and categorize individual studies according to the data, methods, and applications into four categories, namely, analogy encoding, retrieval, mapping, and evaluation. Based on both nuanced organic review and structured analysis, this paper elucidates the state-of-the-art of data-driven DbA research to date and benchmarks it with the frontier of data science and AI research to identify promising research opportunities and directions for the field. Finally, we propose a future conceptual data-driven DbA system that integrates all propositions.},
