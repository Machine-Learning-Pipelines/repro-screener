Dear reviewers, thank you for your time and constructive feedbacks and comments. Following your advice, we updated the first revision of the paper. In this revision, we have made the following major changes:

* Modified **Section 1** (Introduction) to state our contribution clearer.
* Added **Section 7** (Conclusion), which highlights our contribution and discuss about potential insights.
* Rewrote **Section 4.2** (Eigenvector Correspondence) to give a clearer definition of the eigenvector correspondence matrices as well as providing some intuitive interpretations.
* In **Section 6** (PAC-Bayes Bounds),  added descriptions for the prior used in the calculation PAC-Bayes bound and a figure showing the optimized posterior variance.
* In **Appendix F** (PAC-Bayes Bounds), added descriptions for the prior and how the KL divergence is computed on the eigenbasis.
* In **Section  5.2** (Batch  Normalization), acknowledged previous related works on discovering the phenomenon of BN on eigenspectrum.
* In **Appendix E.1** (Additional Explanations), acknowledged previous related works on class-centered gradient clustering and alignment.
* Moved comments on related previous works from the Appendix to **Section 4.4** (Hessian Eigenspectrum).
* Refined the caption of **fig.3** and **fig.4** to describe the figures more clearly.
* Fixed the bibliography for citing published works from arXiv.

This revision should address some of the questions and confusions in the reviews. We will post individual responses by this week. We respectfully disagree with some of the comments in the reviews and we will also address them in the individual responses.

In addition, we would like to again highlight our contribution and potential insights, which may not be clear from the original version of the paper. These information are also included in the modified introduction and newly added conclusion section accordingly.
