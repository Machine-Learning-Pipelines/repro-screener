Positions of the root coordinate along time: 
GT is depicted in thin black.  
Our scaled prediction is in an overlay on top of the GT, with  'S' and 'E' stating where the start and the end are, respectively.
%, and changes from yellow to red when time progresses. 
Depicted motions are (Human3.6M -- left to right): walk, phone, eat.
