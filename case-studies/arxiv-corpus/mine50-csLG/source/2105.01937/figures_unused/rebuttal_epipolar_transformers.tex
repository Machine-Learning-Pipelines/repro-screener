In a cross-view attention, attended keys should be taken evenly from all views. 
Epipolar Transformers (left): spatial-attention across locations on an epipolar line in a single view.
Ours (right): view-attention across all views.
%Left: attend spatial points in the epipolar line in view 2 to best match the 2D joint in view 1. Right: attend views to best match 3D ground-truth joint rotation.
