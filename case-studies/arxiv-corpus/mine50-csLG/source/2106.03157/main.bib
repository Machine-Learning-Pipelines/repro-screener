  abstract = {One of the most fundamental results in combinatorial optimization is the polynomial-time 3/2-approximation algorithm for the metric traveling salesman problem. It was presented by Christofides in 1976 and is well known as “the Christofides algorithm”. Recently, some authors started calling it “Christofides-Serdyukov algorithm”, pointing out that it was published independently in the USSR in 1978. We provide some historic background on Serdyukov's findings and a translation of his article from Russian into English.
              Одним из самых фундаментальных результатов в области комбинаторной оптимизации является полиномиальный 3/2-приближённый алгоритм для метрической задачи коммивояжёра. Он был представлен Никосом Кристофидесом в 1976г. и хорошо известен под названием <<алгоритм Кристофидеса>>. В последнее время некоторые авторы стали называть его <<алгоритмом Кристофидеса-Сердюкова>>, утверждая, что он был опубликован независимо в СССР в 1978г. В этой статье рассматривается исторический контекст появления результата А. И. Сердюкова и приводится перевод его статьи с русского на английский язык.}

  abstract  = {While logistic sigmoid neurons are more biologically plausible than hyperbolic tangent neurons, the latter work better for training multi-layer neural networks. This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training.}
