\section{Labyrinth}

Section 5.4 evaluates progressive networks on foraging tasks in complex 3D maze
environments. Positive rewards are given to the agent for collecting apples and
strawberries, and negative rewards for mushrooms and lemons.
Episodes terminate when either all (positive) rewards are collected, or after a
fixed time interval.

Levels differ in their maze layout, the type of items present and the sparsity
of the reward structure. The levels we employed can be characterized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Seek Track 1: simple corridor with many apples
\item Seek Track 2: U-shaped corridor with many strawberries
\item Seek Track 3: $\Omega$-shaped, with $90^o$ turns, with few apples
\item Seek Track 4: $\Omega$-shaped, with $45^o$ turns, with few apples
\item Seek Avoid 1: large square room with apples and lemons
\item Seek Avoid 2: large square room with apples and mushrooms
\item Seek Maze M : M-shaped maze, with apples at dead-ends
\item Seek Maze Y : Y-shaped maze, with apples at dead-ends
\end{itemize}
