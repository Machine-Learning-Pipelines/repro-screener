\caption{Modified HalfCheetah environments used for testing. Morphological modifications include a variation on the mass and the radius of a specific part of the body (torso, thighs, shins, or feet). We also modified the dynamics (gravity and friction). Environment names are exhaustive: Big refers to a increase of 25\% of radius and mass, Small refers to a decrease of 25\%. For example, "BigFoot" refers to an HalfCheetah agent where feet have been increased in mass and radius by 25\%. For gravity and friction, we also tried an increase/decrease by 50\% (respectively tagged "Huge" and "Tiny").}
