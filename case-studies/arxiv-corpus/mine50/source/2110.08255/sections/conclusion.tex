\section{Conclusion}

Time series forecasting is an important business and research problem that has a broad impact in today's world. This paper proposes a novel Y-shaped architecture, specifically designed for the far horizon time series forecasting problem. The study shows the importance of direct connections from the multi-resolution encoder to the decoder and reconstruction loss for the task of time series forecasting. The Yformer couples the U-Net architecture from the image segmentation domain on a sparse transformer model and empirically demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets for both univariate and multivariate settings. We believe that our work provides a base for future research in the direction of using efficient U-Net based skip connections and the use of reconstruction loss as an auxiliary loss within the time series forecasting community.
