In this paper, we have defined manifold convolutions and manifold neural networks. We prove that the deformations on the embedded submanifolds can be represented as a form of perturbations to the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Considering the infinite dimensionality of LB operators, we import the definition of frequency difference threshold filters and frequency ratio threshold filters to help separate the spectrum. By assigning similar frequency responses to the eigenvalues that are close enough, these filters can be proved to be stable under absolute and relative perturbations to the LB operator respectively with Lipschitz continuous assumptions. While the manifold filters need to trade-off between the stability and discriminability.  MNNs composed with layers of manifold filters and pointwise nonlinearities can be proved to be stable to absolute and relative perturbations to the LB operators. While the frequency mixing brought by pointwise nonlinearity can help with the discriminability. We conclude that the MNNs are thus both stable to deformations and discriminative. We also show the discretizations of MNNs in both spatial and time domains to make our proposed MNNs implementable. 
We finally verified our results numerically with a point cloud classification problem with ModelNet10 dataset.
