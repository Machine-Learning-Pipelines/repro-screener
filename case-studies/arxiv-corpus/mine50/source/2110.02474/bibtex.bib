An SCEE exists when the model-implied mean and first-order autocorrelation coincide with those predicted by the agents via misspecified forecasting rules. For a simple regime-switching monetary policy model, the parametric space where at least one SCEE exists is rather wide, and may extend well beyond the rational expectations equilibrium determinacy frontier. Misspecified expectations combined with regime switching yield a strong endogenous amplification mechanism that help generate the near unit root dynamics for inflation observed in the United States before the Great Moderation.}

First, it provides a boundedly rational model of how rational expectations can be achieved. Secondly, learning acts as a selection device in models with multiple REE (rational expectations equilibria). Third, the learning dynamics themselves may be of interest. While there are various approaches to learning in macroeconomics, the emphasis here is on adaptive learning schemes in which agents use statistical or econometric techniques in self-referential stochastic systems.Careful attention is given to learning in models with multiple equilibria. The methodological tool is to set up the economic system under learning as a SRA (stochastic recursive algorithm) and to analyze convergence by the method of stochastic approximation based on an associated differential equation. Global stability, local stability and instability results for SRAs are presented. For a wide range of solutions to economic models the stability conditions for REE under statistical learning rules are given by the expectational stability principle, which is treated as a unifying principle for the results presented.Both linear and nonlinear economic models are considered and in the univariate linear case the full set of solutions is discussed. Applications include the Muth cobweb model, the Cagan model of inflation, asset pricing with risk neutrality, the overlapping generations model, the seignorage model of inflation, models with increasing social returns, IS-LM-Phillips curve models, the overlapping contract model, and the Real Business Cycle model. Particular attention is given to the local stability conditions for convergence when there are indeterminacies, bubbles, multiple steady states, cycles or sunspot solutions.The survey also discusses alternative approaches and recent developments, including Bayesian learning, eductive approaches, genetic algorithms, heterogeneity, misspecified models and experimental evidence.},

	abstract = {The role of expectations in economics has long been recognized. However, explicit models of expectation formation are relatively recent. In contemporary macroeconomics, expectations of future variables play a key role in the determination of inflation, consumer expenditures, investment, asset prices, and the business cycle. In the 1950s and 1960s, the adaptive expectations hypothesis was employed widely in both empirical and theoretical work. In the 1970s and 1980s the ‘rational expectations (RE) revolution’ led to a fundamental reformulation. Expectations were modeled as optimal forecasts, given the stochastic process followed by the variables being predicted. Important topics in RE modeling include techniques to compute RE, econometric testing of expectations for ‘rationality’ and the ‘Lucas critique’ of traditional policy evaluation. Some economic models exhibit multiple RE equilibria. Manifestations include coordination failures, asset price bubbles, sunspots and endogenous fluctuations. These ideas formalize an independent role for expectations in economic dynamics. Recent developments in modeling of expectations have raised two related issues. How can agents coordinate on RE? If agents have some more bounded form of rationality, can they ‘learn’ to have RE? An RE equilibrium may or may not be stable under econometric learning. Furthermore, learning behavior can also lead to new economic phenomena.}

	abstract={This paper is a contribution to the analysis of optimal monetary policy. It begins with a critical assessment of the existing literature, arguing that most work is based on implausible models of inflation-output dynamics. It then suggests that this problem may be solved with some recent behavioral models, which assume that price setters are slow to incorporate macroeconomic information into the prices they set. A specific such model is developed and used to derive optimal policy. In response to shocks to productivity and aggregate demand, optimal policy is price level targeting. Base drift in the price level, which is implicit in the inflation targeting regimes currently used in many central banks, is not desirable in this model. When shocks to desired markups are added, optimal policy is flexible targeting of the price level. That is, the central bank should allow the price level to deviate from its target for a while in response to these supply shocks, but it should eventually return the price level to its target path. Optimal policy can also be described as an elastic price standard: the central bank allows the price level to deviate from its target when output is expected to deviate from its natural rate.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>},

	abstract = { We review the psychology and neuroscience of reinforcement learning (RL), which has experienced significant progress in the past two decades, enabled by the comprehensive experimental study of simple learning and decision-making tasks. However, one challenge in the study of RL is computational: The simplicity of these tasks ignores important aspects of reinforcement learning in the real world: (a) State spaces are high-dimensional, continuous, and partially observable; this implies that (b) data are relatively sparse and, indeed, precisely the same situation may never be encountered twice; furthermore, (c) rewards depend on the long-term consequences of actions in ways that violate the classical assumptions that make RL tractable. A seemingly distinct challenge is that, cognitively, theories of RL have largely involved procedural and semantic memory, the way in which knowledge about action values or world models extracted gradually from many experiences can drive choice. This focus on semantic memory leaves out many aspects of memory, such as episodic memory, related to the traces of individual events. We suggest that these two challenges are related. The computational challenge can be dealt with, in part, by endowing RL systems with episodic memory, allowing them to (a) efficiently approximate value functions over complex state spaces, (b) learn with very little data, and (c) bridge long-term dependencies between actions and rewards. We review the computational theory underlying this proposal and the empirical evidence to support it. Our proposal suggests that the ubiquitous and diverse roles of memory in RL may function as part of an integrated learning system. }

Prices of goods offered in the same store but not purchased do not affect inflation expectations, nor do other dimensions.

Two specifications are considered: agents know the current state of monetary policy (full information) and agents use Bayesian updating to infer the policy regime (learning). First, our policy regime estimates are consistent with the view that policy was marked by a shift to a high-inflation regime in the early 1970's which ended with Volcker's stabilization policy. Second, while Bayesian posterior odds favor the full-information version of the model, the fall of interest rates, actual and expected inflation in the early 1980's is better captured by the delayed response of the learning specication. Third, monetary policy shocks of up to two standard deviations essentially do not trigger the Bayesian learning mechanism. Yet due to non-linearities, interventions that lead to small initial interest rate changes may be associated with much larger effects on output and inflation than under full information.

We find support for these predictions using 57 years of microdata on inflation expectations from the Reuters/Michigan Survey of Consumers. Differences in experiences strongly predict differences in expectations, including the substantial disagreement between young and old individuals in periods of highly volatile inflation, such as the 1970s. It also explains household borrowing and lending behavior, including the choice of mortgages. }",

	abstract = {This paper suggests a new approach to solving the one-sector stochastic growth model using the method of parameterized expectations. The approach is to employ a `global’ genetic algorithm search for the parameters of the expectation function followed by a `local’ gradient-descent optimization method to ensure fine-tuning of the approximated solution. We use this search procedure in combination with either polynomial or neural network specifications for the expectation function. We find that our approach yields highly accurate solutions in the case where an exact analytic solution exists as well as in cases where no closed-form solution exists. Our results further suggest that neural network specifications for the expectation function may be preferred to the more commonly used polynomial specifications.}

In fact, these networks can approximate functions that are not differentiable in the classical sense, but possess only a generalized derivative, as is the case for certain piecewise differentiable functions. The conditions imposed on the hidden layer activation function are relatively mild; the conditions imposed on the domain of the function to be approximated have practical implications. Our approximation results provide a previously missing theoretical justification for the use of multilayer feedforward networks in applications requiring simultaneous approximation of a function and its derivatives."
