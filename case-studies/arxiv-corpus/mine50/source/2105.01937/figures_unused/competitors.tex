%\color{orange}Frames from the H3.6M dataset. Shows the strenghts of our work. Predicting bones and rotations help to receive a more smooth motion. At Iskakvot \etal~\cite{iskakov2019learnable} column we can see the at the first row we received a huge right leg, and at the third colum the left elbow is rotated inside in a non-natural way. Comparing our results against Shi \etal~\cite{shi2020motionet} we show the benefits of our multi-view algorithm that produces more accurate results.}
Qualitative comparison of our work vs. non ep-free state-of-the-art (Iskakov \etal~\cite{iskakov2019learnable}) and vs. our single-view baseline (Shi \etal~\cite{shi2020motionet}).}
