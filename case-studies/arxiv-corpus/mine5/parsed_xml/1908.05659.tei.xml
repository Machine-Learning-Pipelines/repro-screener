<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Introduction. Many real-world decision problems arising in engineering and management have uncertain parameters. This parameter uncertainty may be due to limited observability of data, noisy measurements, implementations and prediction errors. Stochastic optimization (SO) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) robust optimization frameworks have classically allowed to model this uncertainty within a decision-making framework. Stochastic optimization assumes that the decision maker has complete knowledge about the underlying uncertainty through a known probability distribution and minimizes a functional of the cost, see, e.g., Shapiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b295">[295]</ref>, Birge and Louveaux <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The probability distribution of the random parameters is inferred from prior beliefs, expert opinions, errors in predictions based on the historical data (e.g., Kim and Mehrotra <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[171]</ref>), or a mixture of these. In robust optimization, on the other hand, it is assumed that the decision maker has no distributional knowledge about the underlying uncertainty, except for its support, and the model minimizes the worst-case cost over an uncertainty set, see, e.g., El Ghaoui and Lebret <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>, El Ghaoui et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>, Ben-Tal and Nemirovski <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Bertsimas and Sim <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, Ben-Tal and Nemirovski <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Ben-Tal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The concept of robust optimization has a relationship with chance-constrained optimization, where in certain cases there is a direct relationship between a robust optimization model and a chance-constrained optimization model, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Boyd and Vandenberghe [57,</ref>.</p><p>We often have partial knowledge on the statistical properties of the model parameters. Specifically, the probability distribution quantifying the model parameter uncertainty is known ambiguously. A typical approach to handle this ambiguity, from a statistical point of view, is to estimate the probability distribution using statistical tools, such as the maximal likelihood estimator, minimum Hellinger distance estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">[311]</ref>, or maximum entropy principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>. The decision-making process can then be performed with respect to the estimated distribution. Because such an estimation may be imprecise, the impact of inaccuracy in estimation-and the subsequent ambiguity in the underlying distribution-is widely studied in the literature through <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> the perturbation analysis of optimization problems, see, e.g., Bonnans and Shapiro <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, (2) stability analysis of a SO model with respect to a change in the probability distribution, see, e.g, Rachev <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">[250]</ref>, Römisch <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">[263]</ref>, or (3) input uncertainty analysis in stochastic simulation models, see, e.g., Lam <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[175]</ref> and references therein. The typical goals of these approaches are to quantify the sensitivity of the optimal value/solution(s) to the probability distribution and provide continuity and/or large-deviation-type results, see, e.g., Dupačová <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>, Schultz <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[272]</ref>, Heitsch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>, Rachev and Römisch <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">[248]</ref>, Pflug and Pichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">[230]</ref>. While these approaches quantify the input uncertainty, they do not provide a systematic modeling framework to hedge against the ambiguity in the underlying probability distribution.</p><p>Ambiguous stochastic optimization is a systematic modeling approach that bridges the gap between data and decision-making-statistics and optimization frameworksto protect the decision-maker from the ambiguity in the underlying probability distribution. The ambiguous stochastic optimization approach assumes that the underlying probability distribution is unknown and lies in an ambiguity set of probability distributions. As in robust optimization, this approach hedges against the ambiguity in probability distribution by taking a worst-case approach. Scarf <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">[271]</ref> is arguably the first to consider such an approach to obtain an order quantity for a newsvendor problem to maximize the worst-case expected profit, where the worst-case is taken with respect to all product demand probability distributions with a known mean and variance. Since the seminal work of Scarf, and particularly in the past few years, significant research has been done on ambiguous stochastic optimization problems. This paper provides a review of the theoretical, modeling, and computational developments in this area. Moreover, we review the applications of the ambiguous stochastic optimization model that have been developed in the recent years. This paper also puts DRO in the context of risk-averse optimization, chance-constrained optimization, and robust optimization.</p><p>1.1. A General DRO Model. We now formally introduce the model formulation that we discuss in this paper. Let x ∈ X ⊆ R n be the decision vector. On a measurable space (Ξ, F), let us define a random vector ξ : Ξ → Ω ⊆ R d , a random cost function h(x, ξ) : X ×Ξ → R, and a vector of random functions g(x, ξ) : X ×Ξ → R m , i.e., g(x, •) := [g 1 (x, •), . . . , g m (x, •)] . Given this setup, a general stochastic optimization problem has the form (SO) inf x∈X R P h(x, ξ) R P g(x, ξ) ≤ 0 , where P denotes the (known) probability measure on (Ξ, F) and R P : Z → R denotes a (componentwise) real-valued functional under P , where Z is a linear space of measurable functions on (Ξ, F). The functional R P accounts for quantifying the uncertainty in the outcomes of the decision, for a given fixed probability measure P . This setup represents a broad range of problems in statistics, optimization, and control, such as regression and classification models <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">163]</ref>, simulation-optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b227">227]</ref>, stochastic optimal control <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, Markov decision processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">[246]</ref>, and stochastic programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b295">295]</ref>. As a special case of (SO), we have the classical stochastic programming problems: , we obtain the class of problems with a probabilistic objective function of the form P { ξ ∈ A(x)}, see, e.g., Prékopa <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[244]</ref>. The set A(x) is called a safe region and may be of the form a(x) ξ ≤ b(x) or a( ξ) x ≤ b( ξ) 1 . Similarly, by taking h(x, ξ) := h(x) and g(x, •) := [1 A1(x) (•), . . . , 1 Am(x) (•)] , for suitable indicator functions 1 Aj (x) (•), j = 1, . . . , m, (1.2) is in the form of probabilistic (i.e., chance) constraints P { ξ ∈ A j (x)} ≤ 0, j = 1, . . . , m, see, e.g., Charnes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, Charnes and Cooper <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, Prékopa <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">[243,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">245]</ref>, Dentcheva <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. Note that the case where the event { ξ ∈ A j (x)} is formed via several constraints is called joint chance constraint as compared to individual chance constraint, where the event { ξ ∈ A j (x)} is formed via one constraint.</p><p>A robust optimization model is defined as (RO) inf are two special cases of (RO). Problem (SO), as well as (1.1) and (1.2), require the knowledge of the underlying measure P , whereas (RO), as well as <ref type="bibr">(1.3)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(1.4)</ref>, ignore all distributional knowledge of ξ, except for its support. An ambiguous version of (SO) is formulated as <ref type="bibr">(DRO)</ref> inf</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x∈X sup P ∈P R P h(x, ξ) sup P ∈P R P g(x, ξ) ≤ 0 .</formula><p>Here, P denotes the ambiguity set of probability measures, i.e., a family of measures consistent with the prior knowledge about uncertainty. Note that if we consider the measurable space (Ω, B), where B denotes the Borel σ-field on Ω, i.e., B = Ω ∩ B(R d ), then P can be viewed as an ambiguity set of probability distributions P defined on (Ω, B) and induced by ξ2 . As discussed before, (DRO) finds a decision that minimizes the worst-case of the functional R of the cost h among all probability measures in the ambiguity set 1 We say a safe region of the form a(x) ξ ≤ b(x) is bi-affine in x and ξ if a(x) and b(x) are both affine in x. Similarly, we say a safe region of the form a( ξ) x ≤ b( ξ) is bi-affine in x and ξ if a( ξ) and b( ξ) are both affine in ξ. Observe that a bi-affine safe region of the form a(x) ξ ≤ b(x) can be equivalently written as a bi-affine safe region of the form a( ξ) x ≤ b( ξ), and vice versa. 2 In this paper, we use P to denote both an ambiguity set of probability measures and an ambiguity set of distributions induced by ξ. Whether P denotes an ambiguity set of probability measures or an ambiguity set of distributions induced by ξ should be understood from the context and the distinction we make between the notation of a probability measure and a probability distribution.</p><p>provided that the (componentwise) worst-case of the functional R of the function g is non-positive. The ambiguous versions of (1.1) and (1.2) are formulated as follows: Models <ref type="bibr">(1.5)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(1.6)</ref> are discussed in the context of minimax stochastic optimization models, in which optimal solutions are evaluated under the worst-case expectation with respect to a family of probability distributions of the uncertain parameters, see, e.g., Scarf <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">[271]</ref>; Žáčková <ref type="bibr" target="#b313">[313]</ref> (a.k.a. Dupačová); Dupačová <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, Breton and El Hachem <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, Shapiro and Kleywegt <ref type="bibr" target="#b292">[292]</ref>, Shapiro and Ahmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">[291]</ref>. Delage and Ye <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> refer to this approach as distributionally robust optimization, in short DRO, and since then, this terminology has become widely dominant in the research community. We adopt this terminology, and for the rest of the paper, we refer to the ambiguous stochastic optimization of the form (DRO) as DRO.</p><p>As mentioned before, (DRO) is a modeling approach that assumes only partial distributional information, whereas (SO) assumes complete distributional information. In fact, if P contains only the true distribution of the random vector ξ, (DRO) reduces to (SO). On the other hand, if P contains all probability distributions on the support of the random vector ξ, supported on U, then, (DRO) reduces to (RO). Thus, a judicial choice of P can put (DRO) between (SO) and (RO). Consequently, (DRO) may not be as conservative as <ref type="bibr">(RO)</ref>, which ignores all distributional information, except for the support U of the uncertain parameters. (DRO) can be viewed as a unifying framework for (SO) and (RO) (see also <ref type="bibr">Qian et al. [247]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Motivation and Contributions.</head><p>In this paper, we provide an overview of the main contributions to DRO within both operations research and machine learning communities. While there are separate review papers on RO, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">124]</ref>, to the best of our knowledge, there are a few tutorials and survey papers on DRO within the operations research community. A tutorial on DRO, its connection to risk-averse optimization, and the use of φ-divergence to construct the ambiguity set is presented in Bayraksan and Love <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Shapiro <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">[290]</ref> provides a general tutorial on DRO and its connection to risk-averse optimization. Postek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">[240]</ref> surveys different papers that address distributionally robust risk constraints, with a variety of risk functional and ambiguity sets. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b290">290,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b240">240]</ref>, in this paper, we show the connection between DRO and risk aversion. However, the current review is different from those in the literature from a number of perspectives. We outline our contributions as follows:</p><p>• We bring together the research done on DRO within the operations research and machine learning communities. This motivation is materialized throughout the paper as we take a holistic view of DRO, from modeling, to solution techniques and to applications. • We provide a detailed discussion on how DRO models are connected to different concepts such as game theory, risk-averse optimization, chanceconstrained optimization, robust optimization, and function regularization in statistical learning.</p><p>• From the algorithmic perspective, we review techniques to solve a DRO model. • From the modeling and theoretical perspectives, we categorize different approaches to model the distributional ambiguity and discuss results for each of these ambiguity sets. Moreover, we discuss the calibration of different parameters used in these ambiguity sets of distributions.</p><p>1.3. Organization of this Paper. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the notation and the basic definitions. Section 3 reviews the connection of DRO to different concepts: game theory in Section 3.1, robust optimization in Section 3.2, risk-aversion and chance-constrained optimization with its relationship to robust optimization in Section 3.3, and regularization in statistical learning in Section 3.4. In Section 4, we review two main solution techniques to solve a DRO model by introducing tools in semi-infinite programming and duality. In Section 5, we discuss different models to construct the ambiguity set of distributions. This includes discrepancy-based models in Section 5.1, moment-based models in Section 5.2, shape-preserving-based models in Section 5.3, and kernel-based models in Section 5. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>. In Section 6, we discuss the calibration of different parameters used in the ambiguity set of distributions. In Section 7, we discuss different functionals that amount for quantifying the uncertainty in the outcomes of a fixed decision. This includes regret functions in Section 7.1, risk measures in Section 7.2, and utility functions in Section 7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>. In Section 8, we introduce some modeling toolboxes for a DRO model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Notation and Basic Definitions.</head><p>In this section, we introduce additional notation used throughout the paper. In order to keep the paper self-contained, we also introduce all definitions used in this paper in this section.</p><p>For a given space Ξ and a σ-field F of that space, we define an underlying measurable space (Ξ, F). In particular, let us define (R d , B(R d )), where B(R d ) is the Borel σ-field on R d . Let 1 A : Ξ → {0, 1} indicate the indicator function of set A ∈ F where 1 A (s) = 1 if s ∈ A, and 0 otherwise. Let M + (•, •) and M(•, •) denote the set of all nonnegative measures and the set of all probability measures Q : F → [0, 1] defined on (Ξ, F), respectively. A measure ν 2 is preferred over a measure ν 1 , denoted as ν 2 ν 1 if ν 2 (A) ≥ ν 1 (A) for all measurable sets A ∈ F. We denote by Q{A} the probability of event A ∈ F, with respect to Q ∈ M (Ξ, F). A random vector ξ : (Ξ, F) → (R d , B(R d )) is always denoted with a tilde sign, while a realization of the random vector ξ is denoted by the same symbol without a tilde, i.e., ξ. For a probability measure Q ∈ M (Ξ, F), we define a probability space (Ξ, F, Q). We denote by Q := Q• ξ−1 the probability distribution induced by a random vector ξ under Q, where ξ−1 denotes the inverse image of ξ. That is, Q : B(R d ) → [0, 1] is a probability distribution on (R d , B(R d )). Let P(•, •) denote the set of all such probability distributions. For example, P(R d , B(R d )) denotes the set of all probability distributions of ξ. Note that in our notation, we make a distinction between a probability measure Q ∈ M (Ξ, F) and a probability distribution Q ∈ P(R d , B(R d )). Nevertheless, we have always an appropriate transformation, so we might use the terminology of probability measure and probability distribution interchangeably. Given this, for a function f : R d → R, we may write Ξ f ( ξ(s))Q(ds) equivalently as R d f (s)Q(ds) with a change of measure. As we shall see later, we may denote f ( ξ(s)) with f (s) in this transformation. For two random variables Z, Z : Ξ → R, we use Z ≥ Z to denote Z(s) ≥ Z (s) almost everywhere (a.e.) on Ξ. A random variable Z is Q-integrable if Z 1 := Ξ |Z|dQ is finite. Two random variables Z, Z are distributionally equivalent, denoted by Z d ∼ Z , if they induce the same distribution, i.e., Q{Z ≤ z} = Q{Z ≤ z}. We also denote by S(Ξ, F) the collection of all F-measurable functions Z : (Ξ, F) → (R, B(R)), where R denotes the extended real line R ∪ {−∞, +∞}.</p><p>For a finite space Ξ with M atoms Ξ = {s 1 , . . . , s M } and F = 2 Ξ , let {q(s 1 ), . . . , q(s M )} be the probabilities of the corresponding elementary events under probability measure Q ∈ M (Ξ, F). As a shorthand notation, we use q = [q 1 , . . . , q M ] T ∈ R M , where q i := q(s i ), i ∈ {1, . . . , M }. A F-measurable function Z : Ξ → R has M outcomes {Z(s 1 ), . . . , Z(s M )} with probabilities {q 1 , . . . , q M }. For short, we identify Z as a vector in R M , i.e., z = [z 1 , . . . , z M ] T with z i := Z(s i ), i ∈ {1, . . . , M }.</p><p>Consider a linear space V, paired with a dual linear space V * , in the sense that a (real-valued) bilinear form •, • : V × V * → R is defined. That is, for any v ∈ V and v * ∈ V * , we have that •, v * : V → R and v, • : V * → R are linear functionals on V and V * , respectively. Similarly, we define W and W * . For a linear mapping A : V → W, we define the adjoint mapping A * : W * → V * by means of the equation w * , Av = A * w * , v , ∀v ∈ V. For two linear mappings, defined by finite dimensional matrices A and B, A • B = T r(A T B) denotes the Frobenius inner product between matrices. Moreover, A B denotes the Hadamard (i.e., componentwise) product between matrices.</p><p>For a function f : V → R, the (convex) conjugate f * : V * → R is defined as For a proper cone K, the relation x K y indicates that y − x ∈ K. For simplicity, we drop K from the notation, when K is the positive semidefinite cone. Let S n + denote the cone of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices in the n × n matrix spaces R n×n . For a cone K ⊂ V, we define its dual cone as K := {v * ∈ V * | v * , v ≥ 0, ∀v ∈ K}. The negative of the dual cone is called polar cone and is denoted by K o . The Kepigraph of a function f : R N → R M and a proper cone K is conic-representable if the set (x, y) ∈ R N × R M f (x) K y can be expressed via conic inequalities, possibly involving a cone different from K and additional auxiliary variables.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f * (v * ) = sup v∈V { v * , v − f (v)}. Similarly, the biconjugate f * * : V → R is defined as f * * (v) = sup v * ∈V * { v * , v −f * (v * )}.</formula><p>For a set K, we use conv(K) and int (K) to denote the convex hull and the interior of K, respectively.</p><p>Because we also review DRO papers in the context of statistical learning in this paper, we introduce some terminologies in statistical learning. For every approach that uses a set of (training) data to prescribe a solution or to predict an outcome, it is important to assess the out-of-sample quality of the prescriber/predictor under a new set of (test) data, independent from the training set. Consider a given set of (training) data {ξ i } N i=1 . Suppose that P N is the empirical probability distribution on {ξ i } N i=1 . Data-driven approaches are interested in the performance of a data-driven solution (or, in-sample solution) xN that is constructed using {ξ i } N i=1 . A primitive data-driven solution for a problem of the form (1.1) can be obtained by solving a sample average approximation (SAA) of that problem, where the underlying distribution is chosen to be P N <ref type="bibr" target="#b295">[295]</ref>. Assessing the quality of this solution is well-studied in the context of SO, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bayraksan</ref> and Morton <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, Homem-De-Mello and Bayraksan <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>. Here, we introduce the analogous of such performance measure that are used to assess the quality of a solution in the context of a DRO model. Let us focus on a DRO problem of the form (1.5) for the ease of exposition. Consider a datadriven solution x N ∈ X . Such a solution may be obtained by solving a data-driven version of the DRO model <ref type="bibr">(1.5)</ref>, where the ambiguity set P is constructed using data, namely P N . The out-of-sample performance of x N is defined as E P true h(x, ξ , which is the expected cost of x N given a new (test) sample that is independent of {ξ i } N i=1 , drawn from an unknown true distribution P true := P true • ξ−1 . However, as P true is unknown, one need to establish performance guarantees. One such guarantee, referred to as finite-sample performance guarantee or generalization bound is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P N E P true h(x N , ξ ≤ VN ≥ 1 − α,</formula><p>which guarantees that an (in-sample) certificate VN provides a (1 − α) confidence (with respect to the training sample) on the out-of-sample performance of x N . The certificate VN may be chosen as the optimal value of the inner problem in DRO, where the worst-case is taken within P N , evaluated at x N , see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref>. The other guarantee, referred to as asymptotic consistency, guarantees that as N increases, the certificate VN and the data-driven solution x N converges-in some sense-to the optimal value and an optimal solution of the true (unambiguous) problem of the form (1.1), see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Relationship with Game</head><p>Theory, Risk-Aversion, Chance-Constrained Optimization, and Regularization.</p><p>3.1. Relationship with Game Theory. In this section, we present a gametheoretic interpretation of DRO. Indeed, a worst-case approach to SO may be viewed to have its roots in John von Neumann's game theory. For ease of exposition, let us consider a problem of the form (1.5).</p><p>The decision maker, the first player in this setup, makes a decision x ∈ X whose consequences (i.e., cost h) depends on the outcome of the random vector ξ. The decision maker assumes that ξ follows some distribution P ∈ P. However, he/she does not know which distribution the nature, the second player in this setup, will choose to represent the uncertainty in ξ. Thus, in one hand, the decision maker is looking for a decision that minimizes the maximum expected cost with respect to P, on the other hand, the nature is seeking a distribution that maximizes the minimum expected cost with respect to X . Under suitable conditions, it can be shown that these two problems are the dual of each other and the solution to one problem provides the solution to the other problem. Such a solution (x * , P * ) is called an equilibrium or saddle point. In other words, at this point, the decision maker would not change its decision x * , knowing that the nature chose P * . Similarly, the nature would not change its distribution P * , knowing that the decision maker chose x * . We state this result in the following theorem, which generalizes John von Neumann's minmax theorem. Theorem 3.1.

Theorem 3.6 relates problems (1.5) and (1.6) to risk-averse optimization problems, involving the coherent risk-measure ρ. Consider a fixed x ∈ X . With an appropriate transformation of measure P = P • ξ−1 , we can write the inner problem sup P∈P E P h(x, ξ) in (1.5) as sup P ∈P E P [h(x, s)], where in the former, P is a set of probability distributions induced by ξ, while in the latter, P is a set of probability measures on (Ξ, F). Then, by applying Theorem 3.6 and setting Z = h(x, ξ), sup P ∈P E P [h(x, s)] evaluates a (real-valued) coherent risk measure ρ [h(x, s)], provided that P ⊂ M (Ξ, F) is a convex compact set. It is easy to verify that such a function ρ is coherent:</p><p>• Translation Equivariance: Consider x ∈ X and a ∈ R.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Then, ρ [h(x, s) + a] = sup P ∈P E P [h(x, s) + a] = sup P ∈P E P [h(x, s)] + a = ρ [h(x, s)] + a. • Positive Homogeneity: Consider x ∈ X and t ≥ 0. Then, ρ [th(x, s)] = sup P ∈P E P [th(x, s)] = t sup P ∈P E P [h(x, s)] = tρ [h(x, s)]. • Monotonicity: Consider x, x ∈ X such that h(x, s) ≥ h(x , s). Thus, E P [h(x, s)] ≥ E P [h(x , s)] for any P ∈ P, which implies ρ [h(x, s)] = sup P ∈P E P [h(x, s)] ≥ sup P ∈P E P [h(x , s)] = ρ [h(x , s)]. • Convexity: Consider x, x ∈ X and t ∈ [0, 1]. Then, we have ρ [th(x, s) + (1 − t)h(x , s)] = sup P ∈P E P [th(x, s) + (1 − t)h(x , s)] ≤ sup P ∈P E P [th(x, s)] + sup P ∈P E P [(1 − t)h(x , s)] = t sup P ∈P E P [h(x, s)] + (1 − t) sup P ∈P E P [h(x , s)] = tρ [h(x, s)] + (1 − t)ρ [h(x , s)] ,</formula><p>where we used the translation equivariance property. Consequently, (1.5) is equivalent to minimizing a coherent risk measure. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">(1.6</ref>) is equivalent to a risk-averse optimization problem, subject to coherent risk constraints. Thus, a convex and compact ambiguity set of distributions gives rise to a coherent risk measure. Conversely, Theorem 3.6 implies that given a risk preference that can be expressed in the form of a coherent risk measure as a primitive, we can construct a corresponding convex and compact ambiguity set P of probability distributions in a DRO framework. Thus, the ambiguity set becomes a consequence of the particular risk measure the decision maker selects.</p><p>It is worth noting that if h is a convex random function in (1.5), i.e., h(•, ξ) is convex in x for almost every ξ, then, ρ h(•, ξ) is convex in x.

In the previous section, we discussed how DRO is connected to risk-averse optimization. In this section, we present another perspective that connects DRO to risk-averse optimization through a proper choice of the uncertainty set of the random variables ξ, as in RO.</p><p>Many approaches in RO construct the uncertainty set for the parameters ξ such that the uncertainty set implies a probabilistic guarantee with respect to the true unknown distribution. To explain how this construction is related to risk and DRO, consider the uncertain constraints g(x, ξ) ≤ 0 for a fixed x. Suppose that ξ belongs to a bounded uncertainty set U ⊆ R d , i.e., U is the support of ξ. The RO counterpart of this constraint then can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">(3.3) g(x, ξ) ≤ 0, ∀ξ ∈ U.</formula><p>Two criticisms of (3.3) are that: (1) it treats all uncertain parameters ξ ∈ U with equal weights and (2) all the parametrized constraints are hard, i.e., no violation is accepted. An alternative framework to reduce the conservatism caused by this approach is to use a chance constraint framework that allows a small probability of violation (with respect to the probability distribution of ξ) instead of enforcing the constraint to be satisfied almost everywhere. Under the assumption that ξ is defined on a probability space (Ξ, F, P true ), the chance constraint framework can be represented as follows:</p><p>(3.4)</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">P true {g(x, ξ) ≤ 0} ≥ 1 − ,</formula><p>for some 0 &lt; &lt; 1.

In fact, as goes to zero, the set</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">X := x ∈ X P true {g(x, ξ) ≤ 0} ≥ 1 − decreases to X (U) := {x ∈ X | g(x, ξ) ≤ 0, ∀ξ ∈ U}.</formula><p>Motivated by the chance constraint framework (3.4), many approaches in RO construct an uncertainty set U such that a feasible solution to a problem of the form (3.3) will also be feasible with probability at least 1 − with respect to P true . More precisely, for any fixed x, these constructions guarantee that the following implication holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">(C1) If g(x, ξ) ≤ 0, ∀ξ ∈ U , then, P true {g(x, ξ) ≤ 0} ≥ 1 − .</formula><p>However, as we argued before, the probability measure P true cannot be known with certainty. As far as it is relevant to the scope and interest of this paper, there are two streams of research in order to handle the ambiguity about the true probability distribution and obtain a safe (or, conservative) approximation 5 to (3.4) 6 : (1) scenario approximation scheme of (3.3) based on Monte Carlo sampling, see, e.g., Campi and Calafiore <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, Calafiore and Campi <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, Nemirovski and Shapiro <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">[214]</ref>, Campi and Garatti <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, Luedtke and Ahmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[198]</ref>, Ben-Tal and Nemirovski <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and (2) DRO approach to (3.4), see, e.g., Nemirovski and Shapiro <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[213]</ref>, Erdogan and Iyengar <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>. Research on scenario approximation of (3.3) focuses on providing probabilistic guarantee (with respect to the sample probability measure) that a solution to the sampled problem of (3.3) is feasible to (3.4) with a high probability.</p><p>The DRO approach, on the other hand, forms a version of (3.4) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">(3.5) P {g(x, ξ) ≤ 0} ≥ 1 − , ∀P ∈ P ≡ inf P ∈P P {g(x, ξ) ≤ 0} ≥ 1 − .</formula><p>Let X denote the feasibility set induced by (3.5):</p><p>X := x ∈ X inf</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">P ∈P P {g(x, ξ) ≤ 0} ≥ 1 − .</formula><p>If P true ∈ P, then, x ∈ X implies x ∈ X . That is, X provides a conservative approximation to X 7 . By leveraging a goodness-of-fit test, Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> construct a (1 − α)-confidence region P(α) for P true . Such a construction leads to an uncertainty set U (α) that guarantees the implication (C1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Let us now assume that the sample space Ξ is finite. By the relationship between RO and DRO, discussed in Section 3.2, one may think the parameter ξ in (3.3) represents a probability distribution p on R d , which is random. That said, we may define f (x, p) := R p g(x, ξ) .

Moreover, for any y ∈ R d , let l (y; α) be a closed, convex, finite-valued, and positively homogeneous (in y) upper bound to the worst-case VaR of y p at level 1 − over P (α), i.e., sup P ∈P (α) VaR P 1− y p ≤ l (y; α), y ∈ R d . Then, the closed, convex set P (α) for which δ * y|P (α) = l (y; α) guarantees the implication (C2) with probability at least (1 − α) (with respect to the sample probability measure).</p><p>As a byproduct of Theorem 3.9, δ * y|P (α) ≤ b provides a safe approximation to sup P ∈P (α) P {y p ≤ b} ≥ 1 − .

Two other interesting results can be inferred from Theorem 3.11 about the connection between DRO and regularization: (i) the shape of the transportation cost c in the definition of the optimal transport discrepancy directly implies the type of regularization, and (ii) the size of the ambiguity set is related to the regularization parameter. An important implication of these results is that one can judicially choose an appropriate regularization parameter for the problem in hand by using the DRO equivalent reformulation. We review the papers that draw this conclusion in Section 5.1. Now, let us focus on DRO problems formulated via φ-divergences. For two probability measures P 1 , P 2 ∈ M (Ξ, F), the φ-divergence between P 1 and P 2 is defined as d φ (P 1 , P 2 ) := Ξ φ dP1 dP2 dP 2 , where the φ-divergence function φ : R + → R + ∪ {+∞} is convex, and it satisfies the following properties: φ(1) = 0, 0φ 0 0 := 0, and aφ a 0 := a lim t→∞ φ(t) t if a &gt; 0 9 .</p><p>9 One can similarly define the φ-divergence between two probability distributions P 1 and P 2 induced by ξ.</p><p>Theorem 3.12. (Duchi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 2]</ref>) Consider an ambiguity set of probability distributions as P φ (P 0 ; ) := P ∈ P(R d , B(R d )) d φ (P, P 0 ) ≤ , formed via the φ-divergence d φ (P, P 0 ), where is the size of the ambiguity set and P 0 is the empirical probability distribution on a set of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) data {ξ i } N i=1 , according to P true . Furthermore, suppose that X is compact, there exists a measurable function M : Ω → R + such that for all ξ ∈ Ω, h(•, ξ) is M (ξ)-Lipschitz with respect to some norm • on X , E P true M ( ξ) 2 &lt; ∞, and E P true |h(x 0 , ξ)| &lt; ∞ for some x 0 ∈ X .

Reformulation (4.1) is a semi-infinite program (SIP), and at a first glance, obtaining an optimal solution to this problem looks unreachable 10 . It is well-known that even convex SIPs cannot be solved directly with numerical methods, and in particular are not amenable to the use of methods such as interior point method. Therefore, a key step of the solution techniques to handle the semi-infinite qualifier (i.e., ∀P ∈ P) is to reformulate (4.1) as an optimization problem that is amenable to the use of available optimization techniques and off-the-shelf solvers. Of course, the complexity and tractability of such SIPs and their reformulations depend on the geometry and properties of both the ambiguity set P and the functions h(x, ξ) and g(x, ξ). As we shall see in details in Section 5, proper assumptions on P and these functions are important in most studies on DRO in order to obtain a solvable reformulation or approximation of (4.1).</p><p>In the context of DRO, there are two main approaches to handle the semi-infinite quantifier ∀P and to numerically solve (4.1). Both approaches have their roots in the SIP literature, and they both aim at getting rid of the quantifier ∀P , but in different ways.</p><p>4.1. Cutting-Surface Method. The first approach replaces the quantifier ∀P by for some finite atomic subset of P. The idea is to successively solve a relaxed problem of (4.1) over a finitely generated inner approximations of the ambiguity set P. To be precise, this approach approximates the semi-infinite constraints for all P ∈ P by finitely many ones over a finite set of probability distributions. In each iteration of this approach, a new probability distribution is added to this finite set until optimality criteria are met. We refer to this as a cutting-surface method (also known as exchange method, following the terminology in the SIP literature, see, e.g., Mehrotra and Papp <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[202]</ref>, Hettich and Kortanek <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>). We refer to Pflug and Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[229]</ref>, Rahimian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[251]</ref>, Bansal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> as examples of this approach in the context of DRO.</p><p>The key requirements in order to use the cutting-surface method are the abilities to (i) solve a relaxation of (4.1) with a finite number of probability distributions to optimally and (ii) generate an -optimal solution 11 to a distribution separation subproblem <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[200]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 4.1. (Luo and Mehrotra <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[200,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 3.2]</ref>) Suppose that X × P is compact, and R P h(x, ξ) and R P g(x, ξ) are continuous on X × P. Moreover, suppose that we have an oracle that generates an optimal solution (x k , θ k ) to a relaxation of problem (4.1) for any finite set P k ⊆ P, and an oracle that generates an -optimal solution of the distribution generation subproblem sup P ∈P max R P h(x, ξ) , R P g 1 (x, ξ) , . . . , R P g m (x, ξ) for any x ∈ X and &gt; 0. Suppose that iteratively the relaxed master problem is solved to optimally and yields the solution (x k , θ k ), and the distribution separation subproblem is solved to 2 -optimality and yields the solution P k . Then, the stopping criteria R P h(x, ξ) ≤ θ k + 2 and R P g j (x, ξ) ≤ 2 , j = 1, . . . , m, guarantee that an -feasible solution 12 to problem (4.1), yielding an objective function value lower bounding the optimal value of (4.1), can be obtained in a finite number of iterations.</p><p>It is worth noting that the distribution generation subproblem in the cuttingsurface method may be a nonconvex optimization problem. One may efficiently solve (DRO) through the cutting-surface method if the ambiguity set P can be convexfied without causing a change to the optimal value. The following lemma states that if R P [•] is convex in P on M (Ξ, F), then, it can be assumed without loss of generality that P is convex. Lemma 4.2. Consider (DRO). For a fixed x ∈ X , suppose that R P [•] is convex in P on M (Ξ, F). Then, x * ∈ X is an optimal solution to (DRO) if and only if it is an optimal solution to the following problem: Proof. Problems (DRO) and (4.2) can be reformulated, respectively, as min{θ | (x, θ) ∈ G} and min{θ | (x, θ) ∈ G }, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">G := (x, θ) ∈ R n+1 x ∈ X , R P h(x, ξ) ≤ θ, R P g(x, ξ) ≤ 0, ∀P ∈ P ,<label>and</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_36">G := (x, θ) ∈ R n+1 x ∈ X , R P h(x, ξ) ≤ θ, R P g(x, ξ) ≤ 0, ∀P ∈ conv(P) .</formula><p>Because P ⊆ conv(P ), we have G ⊆ G, and thus, an optimal solution to (4.2) is optimal to (DRO). We now show that G ⊆ G . Consider an arbitrary (x, θ) ∈ G. For an arbitrary P ∈ conv(P), there exists a collection {P i } i∈I such that P = i∈I λ i P i , where i∈I λ i = 1, P i ∈ P, λ i ≥ 0, i ∈ I. Now, by the convexity of R P [•] in P on M (Ξ, F), we have R P h(x, ξ) ≤ i∈I λ i R P i h(x, ξ) ≤ θ and R P g(x, ξ) ≤ i∈I λ i R P i g(x, ξ) ≤ 0. Thus, it follows that (x, θ) ∈ G , and hence, G ⊆ G .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Dual Method.</head><p>The second approach to solve (DRO) handles the quantifier ∀P through the dualization of sup P ∈P R P h(x, ξ) and sup P ∈P R P g(x, ξ) ≤ 0. Under suitable regularity conditions, there is no duality gap between the primal problem and its dual, i.e., strong duality holds. Hence, the supremum can be replaced by an infimum which should hold for at least one corresponding solution in the dual space. We refer to this approach as a dual method. Most of the existing papers in the DRO literature are focused on the dual method, see, e.g., Delage and Ye <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b317">[317]</ref>, Ben-Tal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. A situation where one benefits from the application of the dual method to solve (DRO) arises in cases where the ambiguity set of probability distribution depends on decision x as formulated below, see, e.g., Luo and Mehrotra <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[199]</ref>, Noyan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">[221]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">(4.3) inf x∈X sup P ∈P(x)</formula><p>R P h(x, ξ) sup</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">P ∈P(x) R P g(x, ξ) ≤ 0 ,</formula><p>where, P(x) denotes a decision-dependent ambiguity set of the probability distributions.</p><p>The papers that rely on the dual method exploit linear duality, Lagrangian duality, convex analysis (e.g., support function, conjugate duality, Fenchel duality), and conic duality. A fundamental question is then under what conditions the strong duality holds. One such condition is the existence of a probability measure that lies in the interior of the ambiguity set, i.e., the ambiguity set satisfies a Slater-type condition. We refer the readers to the optimization textbooks for results on linear and Lagrangian duality, see, e.g., Bazaraa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Bertsekas <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, Ruszczyński <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">[269]</ref>, Rockafellar <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">[257]</ref>. For detailed discussions of the duality theory in infinite-dimensional convex problems, we refer to Rockafellar <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">[257]</ref>, and we refer to Isii <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref> and Shapiro <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">[284]</ref> for duality theory in conic linear programs. Below, we briefly present the results from conic duality that are widely used in the dualization of DRO models. where, C and K are convex cones and subsets of linear spaces V and W, respectively, such that for any w * ∈ W * , there exists a unique v * ∈ V * with w * , Av = v * , v , with v * = A * w * , for all v ∈ V. Then, the dual problem to (4.4) is written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">max w * ∈K w * , b (4.5a) s.t. A * w * C c. (4.5b)</formula><p>Moreover, there is no duality gap between (4.4) and (4.5) and both problems have optimal solutions if and only if there exists a feasible pair (v, w * ) such that w * , Av − b = 0 and c − A * w * , v = 0.</p><p>It is worth noting that other numerical methods to solve a SIP, such as penalty methods, see, e.g., Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[190]</ref>, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b336">[336]</ref>, smooth approximation and projection methods, see, e.g., Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">[332]</ref>, and primal methods, see, e.g., Wang and Yuan <ref type="bibr" target="#b314">[314]</ref>, have not been popular in the DRO literature, although there are a few exceptions. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[192]</ref> propose to discretize DRO by a min-max problem in a finite dimensional space, where the ambiguity set is replaced by a set of distributions on a discrete support set. Then, they consider lifting techniques to reformulate the discretized DRO as a saddle-point problem, if needed, and implement a primal-dual hybrid algorithm to solve the problem. They showcase this method for cases where the ambiguity set is formed via the moment constraints as in <ref type="bibr">(5.23)</ref> or the Wasserstein metric, and they present the quantitative convergence of the optimal value and optimal solutions. Other iterative primal methods that have been proposed to solve a DRO model include Lam and Ghosh <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref> for χ 2 -distance, and Ghosh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref>, Namkoong and Duchi <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[208]</ref>, Ghosh and Lam <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref> for general φ-divergences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>Choice of Ambiguity Set of Probability Distributions. The ambiguity set of distribution in a DRO model provides a flexible framework to model uncertainty by allowing the modelers to incorporate partial information about the uncertainty, obtained from historical data or domain-specific knowledge. This information includes, but it is not limited to, support of the uncertainty, discrepancy from the reference distribution, descriptive statistics, and structural properties, such as symmetry and unimodality. Early DRO models considered ambiguity sets based on the support and moment information, for which techniques in global optimization for polynomial optimization problems and problem of moments are applied to obtain reformulations, see, e.g., Lasserre <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref>, Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, Bertsimas and Popescu <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, Popescu <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[238,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b239">239]</ref>, Gilboa and Schmeidler <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>. Since then, many researchers have incorporated information such as descriptive statistics as well as the structural properties of the underlying unknown true distribution into the ambiguity set.</p><p>There are usually two principles to choose the ambiguity set: (1) P should be chosen as small as possible, (2) P should contain the unknown true distribution with certainty (or at least, with a high confidence). Abiding by these two principles not only reduces the conservatism of the problem but it also robustifies the problem against the unknown true distribution. These two, in turn, give rise to two questions: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> what should be the shape of the ambiguity set and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> what should be the size of the ambiguity set. We discuss the latter in Section 6, and focus on the shape of the ambiguity set in this section.</p><p>Except for a few exceptions, the common practice in constructing the ambiguity set is that first, the shape of the set is determined by decision makers/modelers. In this step, data does not directly affect the choice of the shape of the ambiguity set. Then, the parameters that control the size of the ambiguity set are chosen in a data-driven fashion. We emphasize that albeit being a common practice, the size and shape of the ambiguity set might not necessarily be chosen separately. To make the transition between Section 5 and 6 somewhat smoother, we devote Section 5.4 to review those papers that address these two questions simultaneously.</p><p>When dealing with the question of the shape of the ambiguity set, most researchers, on one hand, have focused on the ambiguity sets that facilitate a tractable (exact or conservative approximate) formulation, such as linear program (LP), secondorder cone program (SOCP), or to a lesser degree, semidefinite program (SDP), so that efficient computational techniques can be developed. On the other hand, many researchers have focused on the expressiveness of the ambiguity set by incorporating information such as descriptive statistics as well as the structural properties of the underlying unknown true distribution.</p><p>In what follows in this section, we review different approaches to model the distributional ambiguity. We acknowledge that the ambiguity sets in the literature are typically categorized in two groups: moment-based and discrepancy-based ambiguity sets. In short, moment-based ambiguity sets contain distributions whose moments satisfy certain properties, while discrepancy-based ambiguity sets contain distributions that are close to a nominal distribution in the sense of some discrepancy measure. Within these two groups, some specific ambiguity sets have been given names, see, e.g., Hanasusanto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>. For example,</p><p>• Markov ambiguity set contains all distributions with known mean and support, • Chebyshev ambiguity set contains all distributions with bounds on the firstand second-order moments, • Gauss ambiguity set contains all unimodal distributions from within the Chebyshev ambiguity set, • Median-absolute deviation ambiguity set contains all symmetric distributions with known median and mean absolute deviation, • Huber ambiguity set contains all distributions with known upper bound on the expected Huber loss function, • Hoeffding ambiguity set contains all componentwise independent distributions with a box support, • Bernstein ambiguity set contains all distributions from within the Hoeffding ambiguity set subject to marginal moment bounds, • Choquet ambiguity set contains all distributions that can be written as an infinite convex combination of extremal distributions of the set, • Mixture ambiguity set contains all distributions that can be written as a mixture of a parametric family of distributions. While we use the above terminology in this paper, we categorize DRO papers into four groups:</p><p>• Discrepancy-based ambiguity sets (Section 5.1),</p><p>• Moment-based ambiguity sets (Section 5.2),</p><p>• Shape-preserving ambiguity sets (Section 5.3),</p><p>• Kernel-based ambiguity sets (Section 5.4). We briefly mentioned what is meant by discrepancy-based and moment-based ambiguity sets. In short, shape-preserving ambiguity sets contain distributions with similar structural properties (e.g., unimodality, symmetry). Kernel-based ambiguity sets also contain distributions that are formed via a kernel and its parameters are close to the parameters of a nominal kernel function. The above groups are not necessarily disjoint from a modeling perspective and there are some overlaps between them. However, we try to assign papers to these categories as close as possible to what the authors explicitly or implicitly might have stated in their work.</p><p>We review these four groups of ambiguity sets in Sections 5.1-5.4. Finally, we review the papers that are general and do not consider a specific form for the ambiguity set in Section 5.5.</p><p>5.1. Discrepancy-Based Ambiguity Sets. In many situations, we have a nominal or baseline estimate of the underlying probability distribution. A natural way to hedge against the distributional ambiguity is then to consider a neighborhood of the nominal probability distribution by allowing some perturbations around it. So, the ambiguity set can be formed with all probability distributions whose discrepancy or dissimilarity to the nominal probability distribution is sufficiently small. More precisely, such an ambiguity set has the following generic form:</p><p>(5.1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">P d (P 0 ; ) = {P ∈ M (Ξ, F) | d(P, P 0 ) ≤ },</formula><p>where P 0 denotes the nominal probability measure, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">d : M (Ξ, F) × M (Ξ, F) → R + ∪</formula><p>{∞} is a functional that measures the discrepancy between two probability measure P, P 0 ∈ M (Ξ, F), dictating the shape of the ambiguity set. Moreover, parameter ∈ [0, ∞] controls the size of the ambiguity set, and it can be interpreted as the decision maker's belief in P 0 . Parameter is also referred to as the level of robustness.</p><p>A generic ambiguity set of the form (5.1) has been widely studied in the DRO literature. We relegate the discussion about P 0 and to Section 6. In this section, we review different discrepancy functionals d(•, •) that are used in the literature. These include (i) optimal transport discrepancy, (ii) φ-divergences, (iii) total variation metric, (iv) goodness-of-fit test, (v) Prohorov metric, (vi) p -norm, (vii) ζ-structure metric, (viii) Levy metric, and (ix) contamination neighborhood. We emphasize that although all studied functionals d can quantify the discrepancy between two probability measures, they may or may not be a metric. For example, Prohorov and total variation are probability metrics, see, e.g., Gibbs and Su <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>, while Kullback-Leibler and χ 2 -distance from the family of φ-divergences are not a probability metric. Thus, we refer to the models of the form (5.1) collectively as discrepancy-based ambiguity sets.</p><p>5.1.1. Optimal Transport Discrepancy. We begin this section by providing more details on the optimal transport discrepancy. Consider two probability measures P 1 , P 2 ∈ M (Ξ, F).

We shall shortly comment on similar results in the literature but under stronger assumptions. As shown in Section 3.4, by using Theorem 5.1 or its weaker forms, researchers have shown many mainstream machine learning algorithms, such as regularized logistic regression and LASSO, have a DRO representation, see, e.g., Blanchet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, Blanchet and Kang <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>, Gao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>, Shafieezadeh-Abadeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">[273,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b274">274]</ref>.</p><p>While a strong duality result for DRO formed via the optimal transport discrepancy is provided in Blanchet and Murthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> under mild assumptions by utilizing Fenchel duality, Mohajerin Esfahani and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref> and Gao and Kleywegt <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> are also among notable papers in this area. Below, we first highlight the main differences of Mohajerin Esfahani and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref> and Gao and Kleywegt <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> with Blanchet and Murthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.

On the other hand, Gao and Kleywegt <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> consider a more general setting than the one in Mohajerin Esfahani and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref>, but slightly more restricted than that of Blanchet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. More precisely, in contrast to Blanchet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, it is assumed in Gao and Kleywegt <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> that the transportation cost c(•, •) forms a metric on the underlying Polish space.</p><p>Mohajerin Esfahani and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref> study data-driven DRO problems formed via 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm on R n . The main contribution of Mohajerin Esfahani and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref> is in proving a strong duality result for the studied problem and to reformulate it as a finite-dimesnional convex program for different cost functions, including a pointwise maximum of finitely many concave functions, convex functions, and sums of maxima of concave functions. This contribution is of importance as most of the previous research on DRO formed via Wasserstein ambiguity sets reformulates the problem as a finite-dimensional nonconvex program and relies on global optimization techniques, such as difference of convex programming, to solve the problem, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">[319,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 6]</ref>. In addition, Mohajerin Esfahani and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref> propose a procedure to construct an extremal distribution (respectively, a sequence of distributions) that attains the worst-case expectation precisely (or, asymptotically). They further show that their solutions enjoy finite-sample and asymptotic consistency guarantees.

Recognizing the fact that the ambiguity set should be chosen judicially for the application in hand, they argue that by using the Wasserstein metric the resulting distributions hedged against are more reasonable than those resulting from other popular choices of sets, such as φ-divergence-based sets, see Section 5.1.2. They prove a strong duality result for the studied problem by utilizing Lagrangian duality and approximate the worst-case distributions (or obtain a worst-case distribution, if it exists) explicitly via the firstorder optimality conditions of the dual reformulation. Using this, they show datadriven DRO problems can be approximated by robust optimization problems.</p><p>In addition to the papers by Blanchet and Murthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, Mohajerin Esfahani and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref>, Gao and Kleywegt <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>, there are other research on DRO problems formed via the optimal transport discrepancy, but under more restricted assumptions, that move the frontier of research in this area. In the following review, we mention the properties of the transportation cost c(•, •) in the definition of the optimal transport discrepancy, function g(x, ξ) or h(x, ξ), and the nominal distribution P 0 and its underlying space as studied in these papers. Zhao and Guan <ref type="bibr" target="#b343">[343]</ref> study a datadriven distributionally robust two-stage stochastic linear program over a Wasserstein ambiguity set, with 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing 1 -norm. By developing a strong duality result, they reformulate the problem as a semi-infinite linear two-stage robust optimization problem. In addition, under mild conditions, they derive a closed-form expression of the worst-case distribution whose parameters can be obtained by solving a traditional two-stage robust optimization model. They also show the convergence of the problem to the corresponding stochastic program under the true unknown probability distribution as the data points increase.</p><p>Hanasusanto and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref> derive conic programming reformulation to distributionally robust two-stage stochastic linear programs formed via p-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm. In particular, by relying on the strong duality result from Mohajerin Esfahani and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref> and Gao and Kleywegt <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>, they show that when the ambiguity set is formed via the 2-Wasserstein metric around a discrete distribution, the resulting model is equivalent to a copositive program of polynomial size (if the problem has complete recourse) or it can be approximated by a sequence of copositive programs of polynomial size (if for any fixed x and ξ, the dual of the second-stage problem is feasible). Moreover, by using nested hierarchies of semidefinite approximations of the (intractable) copositive cones from the inside, they obtain sequences of tractable conservative approximations to the problem. They also show that the two-stage distributionally robust stochastic linear program with nonrandom cost function in the second stage, where the ambiguity set is formed via the 1-Wasserstein metric around a discrete distribution is equivalent to a linear program. They further extend their result to a case where optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> is used as a risk measure. As applications, they demonstrate their results for the least absolute deviations regression and multitask learning problems.</p><p>For random variables supported on a compact set and a bounded continuous function h(x, •), Luo and Mehrotra <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[200]</ref> study <ref type="bibr">(1.5)</ref> formed via the 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm, around the empirical distribution of data. They present an equivalent SIP reformulation of the problem by reformulating the inner problem as a conic linear program. In order to solve the resulting SIP, they propose a finitely convergent exchange method when the cost function h is a general nonlinear function in x, and a central cutting-surface method with a linear rate of convergence when the cost function h(•, ξ) is convex in x and X is convex. They investigate a logistic regression model to exemplify their algorithmic ideas, and the benefits of using 1-Wasserstein metric.</p><p>Pflug and Pichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[231]</ref> study a DRO approach to single-and two-stage stochastic programs formed via the p-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm. They assume that all probability distributions in the ambiguity set are supported on discrete, fixed atoms, while only the probabilities of atoms are changing in the ambiguity set. Hence, the ambiguity set can be represented as a subset of a finite-dimensional space. To solve the resulting problem, they apply the exchange method, proposed in Pflug and Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[229]</ref>. Mehrotra and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[203]</ref> study a distributionally robust ordinary least squares problem, where the ambiguity set of probability distribution is formed via 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing 1 -norm. Similar to Pflug and Pichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[231]</ref>, they restrict the ambiguity set of distributions to all discrete distributions and show that the resulting problem can be solved by using an equivalent SOCP reformulation.</p><p>Unlike Pflug and Pichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[231]</ref> and Mehrotra and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[203]</ref> that only allow varying the probabilities on atoms identical to those of the nominal distribution, the ambiguity set is allowed to contain an infinite-dimensional distribution in Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">[319]</ref>. Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">[319]</ref> study a DRO approach to single-stage stochastic programs, where the distributional ambiguity in the constraints and objective function is modeled via 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing 1 -norm around the empirical distribution. Because such a model has a higher complexity than that of those considered in Pflug and Pichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[231]</ref> and Mehrotra and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[203]</ref>, they propose to reformulate the problem into an equivalent finite-dimensional, nonconvex saddle-point optimization problem, under appropriate conditions. The key ideas in Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">[319]</ref> to obtain such a reformulation are that (i) at any level of precision and in the sense of Kantorovich distance, every distribution in the ambiguity set can be approximated via a probability distribution supported on a uniform number of atoms, and (ii) considering only the extremal distributions in the ambiguity set suffices to obtain the equivalent reformulation. Furthermore, for a portfolio selection problem complemented via a broad class of convex risk measures appearing in the constraints, they obtain an equivalent finite-dimensional, nonconvex, semidefinite saddle-point optimization problem. They propose to solve such a reformulated problem via the exchange method, proposed in Pflug and Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[229]</ref>.</p><p>Pichler and Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[236]</ref> study a DRO model with a distortion risk measure and form the ambiguity set of distributions via p-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm. They quantitatively investigate the effect of the variation of the ambiguity set on the optimal value and the optimal solution in the resulting optimization problem, as the number of data points increases. They illustrate their results in the context of a two-stage stochastic program with recourse.</p><p>A class of data-driven distributionally robust fractional optimization problems, representing a reward-risk ratio, is studied in Ji and Lejeune <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref> as follows:</p><p>(5.8) inf</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">x∈X sup P ∈P R 1 P h(x, ξ) R 2 P h(x, ξ)</formula><p>, where R 1 P : Z → R is a reward measure and R 2 P : Z → R + is a nonnegative risk measure. Assuming that the underlying distribution is discrete, Ji and Lejeune <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref> model the ambiguity about discrete distributions using the 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing 1norm, around the empirical distribution. They provide a nonconvex reformulation for the resulting model and propose a bisection algorithm to obtain the optimal value by solving a sequence of convex programming problems. As in Postek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">[240]</ref>, the reformulation is obtained through investigating the support function of the ambiguity set and the convex conjugate of the ratio function. They further apply their results to portfolio optimization problem for the Sharpe ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b296">[296]</ref> and Omega ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by the drawback of moment-based DRO problems, Gao and Kleywegt <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> study DRO formed via various ambiguity sets of probability distributions that incorporate the dependence structure between the uncertain parameters. In the case that there exists a linear dependence structure, they consider probability distributions around a nominal distribution, in the sense of p-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm, satisfying a second-order moment constraint. They also study cases with different rank dependencies between the uncertain parameters. They obtain tractable reformulations of these models and apply their results to a portfolio optimization problem. Along the same lines as Gao and Kleywegt <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>, Pflug and Pohl <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">[232]</ref> study a DRO approach to portfolio optimization via the 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm. They address the case where the dependence structure between the assets is uncertain while the marginal distributions of the assets are known.</p><p>Noyan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">[221]</ref> study DRO model with decision-dependent ambiguity set, where the ambiguity set is formed via the p-Wasserstein metric utilizing p -norm. They consider two types of ambiguity sets: (1) continuous ambiguity set, where there is ambiguity in both probability distribution of ξ and its realizations, and (2) discerte ambiguity set, where there is only ambiguity in the probability distribution of ξ, while the realizations are fixed. They apply their results to problems in machine scheduling and humanitarian logistics.

Discrete Problems. We now review DRO models over Wasserstein ambiguity sets, with discrete decisions. Bansal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> study a distributionally robust integer program with pure binary first-stage and mixed-binary second-stage variables on a finite set of scenarios as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">min x c x + max P ∈P E P h(x, ξ) Ax ≥ b, x ∈ {0, 1} n , where h(x, ξ) = min y q (ξ)y(ξ) W (ξ)y(ξ) ≥ r(ξ) − T (ξ)x, y(ξ) ∈ {0, 1} q1 × R q−q1 .</formula><p>They propose a decomposition-based L-shaped algorithm and a cutting surface algorithm to solve the resulting model. They investigate the conditions and the ambiguity sets under which the proposed algorithm is finitely convergent. They show that the ambiguity set of distributions formed via 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm satisfy these conditions. Xu and Burer <ref type="bibr" target="#b327">[327]</ref> study a mixed 0-1 linear program, where the coefficients of the objective functions are affinely dependent on the random vector ξ. They seek a bound on the worst-case expected optimal value to this problem, where the worst-case is taken with respect to an ambiguity set of discrete distributions formed via 2-Wasserstein metric utilizing 2 -norm around the empirical distribution of data. Under mild assumptions, they reformulate the problem into a copositive program, which leads to a tractable semidefinite-based approximation.</p><p>5.1.1.2. Chance Constraints. In this section, we review distributionally robust chance-constrained programs over Wasserstein ambiguity sets, see, e.g., Jiang and Guan <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref>, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, Xie <ref type="bibr" target="#b322">[322]</ref>, Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b333">[333]</ref>. Ji and Lejeune <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref> study a distributionally robust individual chance constraint, where the ambiguity set of distributions is formed via 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing 1 -norm, and g(x, ξ) in (1.6) is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">g(x, ξ) := 1 [a( ξ) x≤b( ξ)] ( ξ).</formula><p>For the case that the underlying distribution is supported on the same atoms as those of the empirical distribution, they provide mixed-integer LP reformulations for the linear random right-hand side case, i.e., g(x, ξ) := 1 [a x≤ ξ] ( ξ), and the linear random technology matrix case, i.e., g(x, ξ) := 1 [ ξ x≤b] ( ξ), and provide techniques to strengthen the formulations. For the case that the underlying distribution is infinitely supported, they propose an exact mixed-integer SOCP reformulation for models with random right-hand side, while a relaxation is proposed for constraints with a random technology matrix. They show that this mixed-integer SOCP relaxation is exact when the decision variables are binary or bounded general integer.</p><p>Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> study data-driven distributionally robust chance constrained programs, where the ambiguity set of distributions is formed via p-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm. For individual linear chance constraints with affine dependency on the uncertainty, and for joint chance constraints with right-hand side affine uncertainty, they provide an exact deterministic reformulation as a mixed-integer conic program. When 1 -norm or ∞ -norm are used as the transportation cost in the definition of Wasserstein metric, the chance-constrained program can be reformulated as a mixed-integer LP. They leverage the structural insights into the worst-case distributions, and show that both the CVaR and the Bonferroni approximation may give solutions that are inferior to the optimal solution of their proposed reformulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.3.">Statistical</head><p>Learning. DRO problems formed via the optimal transport discrepency has been widely studied in the context of statistical learning. We already mentioned Mehrotra and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[203]</ref> as an example in this area. Below, we review the latest developments of DRO in the context of statistical learning. A data-driven distributionally robust maximum likelihood estimation model to infer the inverse of the covariance matrix of a normal random vector is proposed in Nguyen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[215]</ref>. They form the ambiguity set of distributions with all normal distributions close enough to a nominal distribution characterized by the sample mean and sample covariance matrix, in the sense of the 2-Wasserstein metric utilizing 1 -norm. By leveraging an analytical formula for the Wasserstein distance between two normal distributions, they obtain an equivalent SDP reformulation of the problem. When there is no prior sparsity information on the inverse covariance matrix, they propose a closed-form expression for the estimator that can be interpreted as a nonlinear shrinkage estimator. Otherwise, they propose a sequential quadratic approximation algorithm to obtain the estimator by solving the equivalent SDP. They apply their results to linear discriminant analysis, portfolio selection, and solar irradiation patterns inference problems.</p><p>Lee and Mehrotra <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[183]</ref> study a distributionally robust framework for finding support vector machines via the 1-Wasserstein metric. They provide SIP formulation of the resulting model and propose a cutting-plane algorithm to solve the problem. Lee and Raginsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[184,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">185]</ref> study a distributionally robust statistical learning problem formed via the p-Wasserstein metric utilizing p -norm, motivated by a domain (i.e., measure) adaption problem. This problem arises when training data are generated according to an unknown source domain P, but the learned hypothesis is evaluated on another unknown but related target domain Q. In this problem, it is assumed that a set of labeled data (covariates and responses) is drawn from P and a set of unlabeled covariates is drawn from Q. It is further assumed that the domain drift is due to an unknown deterministic transformation on the covariates space that preserves the distribution of the response conditioned on the covariates. Under these assumptions and some further regularity conditions, they prove a generalization bound and generalization error guarantees for the problem.</p><p>Gao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref> develop a novel distributionally robust framework for hypothesis testing where the ambiguity set of distribution is constructed by 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm, around the empirical distribution. The goal is to obtain the optimal decision rule as well the least favorable distribution by minimizing the maximum of the worst-case type-I and type-II errors. They develop a convex safe approximation of the resulting problem and show that such an approximation renders a nearly-optimal decision rule among the family of all possible tests. By exploiting the structure of the least favorable distribution, they also develop a finite-dimensional convex programming reformulation of the safe approximation.</p><p>We now turn our attention to the connection between DRO and regularization in statistical learning. Pflug et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[233]</ref>, Pichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[235]</ref>, Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b320">[320]</ref> draw the connection between robustification and regularization, where as in Theorem 3.11, the shape of the transportation cost in the definition of the optimal transport discrepancy directly implies the type of regularization, and (ii) the size of the ambiguity set dictates the regularization parameter. Pichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[235]</ref> studies worst-case values of lower semicontinuous and law-invariant risk measures, including spectral and distortion risk measures, over an ambiguity set of distributions formed via the p-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm around the empirical distribution. They show when the function h(x, ξ) is linear in ξ, the worst-case value is the sum of the risk of h(x, ξ) under the nominal distribution and a regularization term. Pflug et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[233]</ref> and Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b320">[320]</ref> show the worst-case value of a convex law-invariant risk measure over an ambiguity set of distributions, formed via the p-Wasserstein metric utilizing p -norm around the empirical distribution, reduces to the sum of the nominal risk and a regularization term whenever the function h(x, ξ) is affine in ξ.They provide closed-form expressions for risk measures such as expectation, sum of expectation and standard deviation, CVaR, distortion risk measure, Wang transform, proportional hazards transform, the Gini measure, and sum of expectation and mean absolute deviation from the median. They apply their results to a portfolio selection problem. Important parts of the derivation of results in Pflug et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[233]</ref>, Pichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[235]</ref>, Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b320">[320]</ref> are Kusuoka's representation of risk measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b287">287]</ref> and Fenchel-Moreau theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b262">[262,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b270">270]</ref>.</p><p>In the context of statistical learning, the connection between DRO and regularization was first made in Shafieezadeh-Abadeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">[273]</ref>, to the best of our knowledge.</p><p>In fact, they study a distributionally robust logistic regression, where an ambiguity set of probability distributions, supported on an open set, is formed around the empirical distribution of data and via the 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm.

As stated in Theorem 3.11, this problem can be interpreted as a standard regularized logistic regression, where the size of the ambiguity set dictates the regularization parameter. They further propose a distributionally robust approach based on Wasserstein metric to compute upper and lower confidence bounds on the misclassification probability of the resulting classifier, based on the optimal values of two linear programs.</p><p>Shafieezadeh-Abadeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">[274]</ref> extend the work of Shafieezadeh-Abadeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">[273]</ref> and study distributionally robust supervised learning (regression and classification) models. They introduce a new generalization technique using ideas from DRO, whose ambiguity set contains all infinite-dimensional distributions in the Wasserstein neighborhood of the empirical distribution. They show that the classical robust and the distributionally robust learning models are equivalent if the data satisfies a dispersion condition (for regression) or a separability condition (for classification). By imposing bound on the decision (i.e., hypothesis) space, they improve the upper confidence bound on the out-of-sample performance proposed in Mohajerin Esfahani and Kuhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref> and prove a generalization bound that does not rely on the complexity of the hypothesis space. This is unlike the traditional generalization bounds that are derived by controlling the complexity of the hypothesis space, in terms of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC)-dimension, covering numbers, or Rademacher complexities <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b276">276]</ref>, which are usually difficult to calculate and interpret in practice. They extend their results to the case that the unknown hypothesis is searched from the space of nonlinear functionals.

For linear function class, this equivalence is exact and results in a new interpretation for discrete choice models, including multinomial logit, nested logit, and generalized extreme value choice models. They also obtain lower and upper bounds on the worst-case expected cost in terms of regularization.</p><p>Mohajerin Esfahani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[206]</ref> study a data-driven inverse optimization problem to learn the objective function of the decision maker, given the historical data on uncertain parameters and decisions. In an environment with imperfect information, they propose a DRO model formed via the p-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm to minimize the worst-case risk of the predicted error. Such a model can be interpreted as a regularization of the corresponding empirical risk minimization problem.

A method for (semi-) supervised learning based on data-driven DRO via p-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm, is proposed in Blanchet and Kang <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. This method enhances the general-ization error by using the unlabeled data to restrict the support of the worst-case distribution in the resulting DRO. They select the level of robustness using crossvalidation, and they discuss the nonparametric behavior of an optimal selection of the level of robustness.</p><p>Chen and Paschalidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> study a DRO approach to linear regression using an 1 -norm cost function, where the ambiguity set of distributions is formed via p-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm. They show that this DRO formulation can be relaxed to a convex optimization problem. By selecting proper norm spaces for the Wasserstein metric, they are able to recover several commonly used regularized regression models. They establish performance guarantees on both the out-of-sample behavior (prediction bias) and the discrepancy between the estimated and true regression planes (estimation bias), which elucidate the role of the regularizer. They study the application of the proposed model to outlier detection, arising in an abnormally high radiation exposure in CT exams, and show it achieves a higher performance than M-estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref>. [52] propose a comprehensive approach for designing the ambiguity set in a datadriven way, using the role of the transportation cost c(•, •) in the definition of the p-Wasserstein metric. They apply various metric-learning procedures to estimate c(•, •) from the training data, where they associate a relatively high transportation cost to two locations if transporting mass between these locations substantially impacts performance. This mechanism induces enhanced out-of-sample performance by focusing on regions of relevance, while improving the generalization error. Moreover, this approach connects the metric-learning procedure to estimate the parameters of adaptive regularized estimators. They select the level of robustness using cross-validation. Blanchet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> propose a data-driven robust optimization approach to optimally inform the transportation cost in the definition of the p-Wasserstein metric. This additional layer of robustification within a suitable parametric family of transportation costs does not exist in the metric-learning approach, proposed in Blanchet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, and it allows to enhance the generalization properties of regularized estimators while reducing the variability in the out-of-sample performance error.</p><p>5.1.1.5. Multistage Setting. The single-and two-stage stochastic programs in Pflug and Pichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[231]</ref> are extended in Analui and Pflug <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and Pflug and Pichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[231]</ref> to the multistage case, where the reference data and information structure is represented as a tree.

Both papers further apply their results to a multiperiod production/inventory control problem. Built upon the above results, Glanzer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref> show that a scenario tree can be constructed out of data such that it converges (in terms of the nested distance) to the true model in probability at an exponential rate.

As it is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, when the uncertain parameter is a finite-dimensional probability vector, the robust counterpart is tractable for most of the choices of φ-divergence function considered in the literature. The use of φdivergence to model the distributional ambiguity in DRO is systematically introduced in Bayraksan and Love <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and Love and Bayraksan <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[197]</ref>. To elucidate the use of φdivergences for models with different sources of data and decision makers with different risk preferences, they present a classification of φ-divergences based on the notions of suppressing and popping a scenario. The situation that a scenario with a positive nominal probability ends up having a zero worst-case probability is called suppressing. On the contrary, the situation that a scenario with a zero nominal probability ends up having a positive worst-case probability is called popping. These notions give rise to four categories of φ-divergences. For example, they show that the variation distance can both suppress and pop scenarios, while Kullback-Leibler divergence can only suppress scenarios. Furthermore, they analyze the value of data and propose a decomposition algorithm to solve the dual of the resulting DRO model formed via a general φ-divergence.</p><p>Motivated by the difficulty in choosing the ambiguity set and the fact that all probability distributions in the set are treated equally (while those outside the set are completely ignored), Ben-Tal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> propose to minimize the expected cost under the nominal distribution while the maximum expected cost over an infinite nested family of ambiguity sets, parametrized by , is bounded from above. More specifically, they allow a varying level of feasibility for each family of probability distributions, where the maximum allowed expected cost for distributions in a set with parameter is proportional to . They refer to this approach as soft robust optimization and relate the feasibility region induced by this approach to the convex risk measures. They illustrate that the ambiguity sets formed via φ-divergences are related to an optimized certainty equivalent risk measure formed via φ-functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Furthermore, they show that the complexity of the soft robust approach is equivalent to that of solving a small number of standard corresponding DRO (i.e., DRO with one ambiguity set) problems. In fact, by showing that standard DRO is concave in , they solve the soft robust model by a bisection method. They also investigate how much larger a feasible region implied by the soft robust approach can cover compared to the standard DRO, without compromising the objective value. Furthermore, they study the downside probability guarantees implied by both the soft robust and standard robust approaches. They also apply their results to portfolio optimization and asset allocation problems.</p><p>A data-driven DRO approach to chance-constrained problems modeled via φdivergences is studied in Yanıkoglu and den Hertog <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[337]</ref>.

For a general φ-divergence, a bisection line search algorithm to obtain the perturbed risk level is proposed in Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>, Jiang and Guan <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref>.

Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref> show that the ambiguous probability minimization problem can be transformed into a corresponding problem under the nominal distribution.

Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref> study distributionally robust supervised learning, where the ambiguity set of distributions is formed via φ-divergences. They prove that such a DRO model for a classification problem gives a classifier that is optimal for the training set distribution rather than being robust against all distributions in the ambiguity set. They argue such a pessimism comes from two sources: the particular losses used in classification and the over-conservation of the ambiguity set formed via φ-divergences. Motivated by this observation, they propose an ambiguity set that incorporates prior expert structural information on the distribution. More precisely, they introduce a latent variable from a prior distribution. While such a distribution can change in the ambiguity set, they leave the ambiguous joint distribution of data conditioned on the latent variable intact. Duchi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> show that the inner problem of a data-driven DRO formed around the empirical distribution, with = χ 2 1,1−α N has an almost-sure asymptotic expansion. Such an expansion is equivalent to the expected cost under the empirical distribution plus a regularization term that accounts for the standard deviation of the objective function. They also show that the set of the optimal solutions of the DRO model converges to that of the stochastic program under the true underlying distribution, provided that h(x, ξ) is lower-semicontinuous.</p><p>5.1.2.2.

The proposed method combines convex parametric function approximation methods (to model the dependence on the endogenous state) with nonparametric kernel regression method (to model the dependence on the exogenous state).

They show that for a linear hypothesis, the problem can be formulated as a SOCP. They also investigate the case where the mean and covariance are unknown and belong to convex uncertainty sets. They show that when the mean is unknown and belongs to an ellipsoid, the problem is a SOCP. On the other hand, when the mean is known and covariance belongs to a matrix norm ball, the problem is a SOCP and adopts a regularization term. For a nonlinear hypothesis, they seek a kernal function to map into a higher-dimensional covariates-response space such that a linear hypothesis in that space corresponds to a nonlinear hypothesis in the original covariate-response space. Using this idea, the model is reformulated as an SOCP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b326">[326]</ref> study a multistage distributionally robust newvendor problem where the support and the first two order moments of the demand distribution are known at each stage.

The first constraint in (5.23) enforces a preference relationship between probability measures. To ensure that P is a probability measure, i.e., P ∈ M (Ξ, F), we set l 1 = u 1 = 1 and f 1 = 1 in the above definition of P M M .

Note that if the first constraint in (5.23) is disregarded (i.e., we only have P 0), then we can form the constraints of a classical problem of moments, see, e.g., Landau <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>.

They study a distributionally robust approach to this problem, where the ambiguity set of distributions is formed via <ref type="bibr">(5.23)</ref> without the first constraint, and propose a discretization scheme to solve the problem. They investigate the behavior of the approximated solution in the number of discrete partitions of the sample space Ξ. As an application, they study robust game in a duoploy market where two players need to make strategic decisions on capacity for future production with anticipation of Nash-Cournot type competition after demand uncertainty is observed. There are studies that consider only lower order moments, up to order 2. Ardestani-Jaafari and Delage <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> study distributionally robust multi-item newsvendor problem, where the ambiguity set of distribution contains all distributions with a known budgeted support, mean, and partial first order moments. To provide a reformulation of the problem, they propose a conservative approximation scheme for maximizing the sum of piecewise linear functions over polyhedral uncertainty set based on the relaxation of an associated mixed-integer LP. They show that for the above studied newsvendor problem such an approximation is exact and it is a linear program. 5.2.3.1. Discrete Problems. Bansal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> study a (two-stage) distributionally robust integer program with pure binary first-stage and mixed-binary second stage decisions on a finite set of scenarios. They propose a decomposition-based L-shaped algorithm and a cutting surface algorithm to solve the resulting model. They investigate the conditions and ambiguity set of distribution under which the proposed algorithm is finitely convergent. They show that ambiguity set of distributions formed via (5.23) without the first constraint, satisfy these conditions.

As an alternative to the affine recourse approximation, they pre-determine a set of finite recourse decisions here-and-now, and implement the best among them after the realization is observed. They form the ambiguity set of distributions as in (5.23) but without the first constraint, where the support is assumed to be a polytope and functions f i are also convex piecewise linear in ξ. They derive an equivalent mixedinteger LP for the resulting model. They also obtain upper and lower bounds on the probability with which any of these recourse decisions is chosen under any ambiguous distribution as linear programs. Postek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">[242]</ref> study a two-stage stochastic integer program, where the second-stage problem is a mixed-integer program. They model the distributional ambiguity by all distributions whose mean and mean-absolute deviation are known. While they show that the problem reduces to a two-stage stochastic program when there is no discrete variables, they develop a general approximation framework for the DRO problem with integer variables. They apply their results to a surgery block allocation problem. 5.2.3.2. Risk and Chance Constraints. Bertsimas and Popescu <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> study the worst-case bound on the probability of a multivariate random vector falling outside a semialgebreic confidence region (i.e., a set described via polynomial inequalities) over an ambiguity set of the form <ref type="bibr">(5.23)</ref>, where functions f are represented by all polynomials of up to kth-order. For the univariate case, they obtain the result as a SDP. In particular, they obtain closed-form bounds, when k ≤ 3. For the multivariate case, they show that such a bound can be obtained via a family of SDP relaxations, yielding a sequence of increasingly stronger, asymptotically exact upper bounds, each of which is calculated via a SDP.

It is worth noting that (5.26) does not cover ambiguity sets that impose infinitely many moment restrictions that would be required to describe symmetry, independence, or unimodality characteristics of the distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>.</p><p>Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318]</ref> determine conditions under which distributionally robust expectation constraints, formed via the proposed ambiguity set (5.26), can be solved in polynomial time as follows: (i) the cost function g j , j = 1, . . . , m, is convex and piecewise affine in x and ξ (i.e., g j (x, ξ) := max k∈{1,...,K} g jk (x, ξ) with g jk (x, ξ) := s jk ( ξ)x + t jk ( ξ) such that s jk ( ξ) and t jk ( ξ) are affine in ξ) and (ii) the confidence sets C i 's satisfy a strict nesting condition. Below, we present a duality result under above assumptions and additional regularity conditions. Theorem 5.13. (Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 1]</ref>) Consider a fixed x ∈ X . Then, under suitable regularity conditions, sup P∈P WKS E P g j (x, ξ) ≤ 0, j = 1, . . . , m, is satisfied if and only if there exists β ∈ R K , κ, λ ∈ R I + , and α ik ∈ K i , i ∈ I and k ∈ {1, . . . , K}, that satisfy the following systems:</p><formula xml:id="formula_109">b β + i∈I (p i κ i − p i λ i ) ≤ 0, c i α ik + s k x + t k ≤ i ∈{i}∪A(i) (κ i − λ i ), ∀i ∈ I, k ∈ {1, . . . , K}, C i α ik + A β = k x + t k , ∀i ∈ I, k ∈ {1, . . . , K}, D i α ik + B β = 0, ∀i ∈ I, k ∈ {1, . . . , K},</formula><p>where A(i) denote the set of all i ∈ I such that C i is strictly contained in the interior of C i .</p><p>The tractability of the resulting system in Theorem 5.13 depends on how the confidence sets C i are described, and hence, they give rise to linear, conic-quadratic, or semidefinite programs for the corresponding confidence sets C i . Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318]</ref> also provide tight tractable conservative approximations for problems that violate the nesting condition by proposing an outer approximation of (5.26). They discuss several mild modifications of the conditions on g.</p><p>There are several papers that use the ambiguity set (5.26) and consider its generalization or special cases. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> introduce an ambiguity set of probability distributions that characterized by conic-representable expectation constraints and a conic-represetable support set, similar to the one studied in Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318]</ref>. However, unlike Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318]</ref>, an infinite number of expectation constraints can be incorporated into the ambiguity set to describe stochastic dominance, entropic dominance, and dispersion, among other. A main result in this work is that for any ambiguity set, there exists an infinitely constrained ambiguity set, such that worstcase expected h(x, ξ) over both sets are equal, provided that the objective function h(x, ξ) is tractable and conic-representable in ξ for any x ∈ X . Reformulation of the resulting DRO model formed via this infinitely constrained ambiguity set yields a conic optimization problem. To solve the model, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> propose a procedure that consists of solving a of relaxed DRO problems-each of which considers a finitely constrained ambiguity set, and results in a conic optimization reformulation-and converges to the optimal value of the original DRO model. When incorporating covariance and fourth-order moment information into the ambiguity set, they show that the relaxed DRO is a SOCP. This is different from Delage and Ye <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> which shows that a DRO problem formed via a fixed mean and an upper bound on covariance is reformulated as a SDP.</p><p>Postek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">[241]</ref> derive exact reformulation of the worst-case expected constraints when function g(x, •) is convex in ξ, and the ambiguity set of distributions consists of all distributions of componentwise independent ξ with known support, mean, and mean-asboulute deviation information. They also obtain exact reformulation of the resulting model when g(x, •) is concave in ξ and there is additional information on the probability that a component is greater than or equal to its mean. These reformulations involve a number of terms that are exponential in the dimension of ξ. They show how upper bounds can be constructed that alleviate the independence restriction, and require only a linear number of terms, by exploiting models in which random variables are linearly aggregated and function g(x, •) is convex. Under the assumption of independent random variables, they use the above results for the worst-case expected constraints to derive safe approximations to the corresponding individual chance constrained problems.</p><p>To reduce the conservatism of the robust optimization due to its constraint-wise approach and the assumption that all constraints are hard for all scenarios in the uncertainty set, Roos and den Hertog <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[264]</ref> propose an approach that bounds worstcase expected total violation of constraints from above and condense all constraints into a single constraint. They form the ambiguity set with all distributions of ξ with known support, mean, and mean-asboulute deviation information. When the right-hand side is uncertain, they use the results in Postek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">[241]</ref> to show that the proposed formulation is tractable. When the left-hand side is uncertain, they use the aggregation approach introduced in Postek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">[241]</ref> to derive tractable reformulations. We also refer to Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">[301]</ref> for a two-stage quadratic stochastic optimization problem and DeMiguel and Nogales <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> for a portfolio optimization problem.</p><p>Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> develop a modular and tractable framework for solving an adaptive distributionally robust two-stage linear optimization problem with recourse of the form min x c x + sup</p><formula xml:id="formula_110">P ∈P E P h(x, ξ) x ∈ X , where h(x, ξ) = min y q y(ξ) W y(ξ) ≥ r(ξ) − T (ξ)x, y(ξ) ∈ R q ,</formula><p>and the function r(ξ) and T (ξ) are affinely dependent on ξ. Both the ambiguity set of probability distributions P and the support set are assumed to be second-order conic-representable. Such an ambiguity set is a special case of the conic-representbale ambiguity set <ref type="bibr">(5.26)</ref>. They show that the studied DRO model can be formulated as a classical RO problem with a second-order conic-representable uncertainty set. To obtain a tractable formulation, they replace the recourse decision functions y(ξ) with generalized linear decision rules that have affine dependency on the uncertain parameters ξ and some auxiliary random variables 21 . By adopting the approach of Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318]</ref> to lift the ambiguity set to an extended one by introducing additional random variables, they improve the quality of solutions and show that one can transform the adaptive DRO problem to a classical RO problem with a second-order conic-representable uncertainty set. Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> discuss extension to the conic-representbale ambiguity set (5.26) and multistage problems.

Then, using Fourier-Motzkin elimination, they reformulate this problem into an equivalent problem with a reduced number of adjustable variables at the expense of an increased number of constraints. Although from a theoretical perspective, every adaptive robust two-stage optimization problem with recourse an equivalent static reformulation, they propose to eliminate some of the adjustable variables, and for the remaining adjustable variables, they impose linear decision rules to obtain an approximated solution. They show that for problems with simplex uncertainty sets, linear decision rules are optimal, and for problems with box uncertainty sets, there exists convex two-piecewise affine functions that are optimal for the adjustable variables. By studying the medical appointment scheduling considered in Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, they show that their approach improves the solutions obtained in Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. 5.2.5.1.

Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> study a problem of the form (1.5), where the cost function h(x, ξ) denotes the optimal value of a linear or discrete optimization problem with random linear objective coefficients. They assume the ambiguity set of distribution is formed by all distributions with known marginals. Using techniques from optimal transport theory, they identify a set of sufficient conditions for the polynomial time solvability of this class of problems. This generalizes the tractability results under marginal information from 0-1 polytopes, studied in Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, to a class of integral polytopes. They discuss their results on four polynomial time solvable instances, arising in the appointment scheduling problem, max flow problem with random arc capacities, ranking problem with random utilities, and project scheduling problems with irregular random starting time costs. 5.2.6.2. Risk and Chance Constraints. Dhara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref> provide bounds on the worst-case CVaR over an ambiguity set of discrete distributions, where the ambiguity set contains all joint distributions whose univariate marginals are fixed and their bivariate marginals are within a minimum Kullback-Leibler distance from the nominal bivariate marginals. They develop a convex reformulation for the resulting DRO. Doan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref> study a DRO model of the form (1.5) with a convex piecewise linear objective function in ξ and affine in x. They form the ambiguity set of joint distributions via a Fréchet class of discrete distributions with multivariate marginals, where the components of the random vector are partitioned such that they have overlaps. They show that the resulting DRO model for a portfolio optimization problem is efficiently solvable with linear programming. In particular, they develop a tight linear programming reformulation to find a bound on the worst-case CVaR over such an ambiguity set, provided that the structure of the marginals satisfy a regularity condition.</p><p>Natarajan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[212]</ref> study a distributionally robust approach to minimize the worst-case CVaR of regret in combinatorial optimization problems with uncertainty in the objective function coefficients, defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_111">min x∈X WCVaR P α h(x, ξ) ,</formula><p>where h(x, ξ) = − ξ x + max y∈{0,1} q 1 ξ y and WCVaR P α h(x, ξ) = sup</p><formula xml:id="formula_112">P ∈P CVaR P α h(x, ξ) .</formula><p>It is assumed that the ambiguity set is formed with the knowledge of marginal distributions, where the ambiguity for each marginal distribution is formed via <ref type="bibr">(5.23)</ref>.</p><p>They reformulate the resulting problem as a polynomial sized mixed-integer LP when (i) the support is known, (ii) the support and mean are known, and (iii) the support, mean, and mean absolute deviation are known; and as a mixed-integer SOCP when the support, mean, and standard deviation are known. They show the maximum weight subset selection problem is polynomially solvable under (i) and (ii). They illustrate their results on subset selection and the shortest path problems. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b341">[341]</ref> study a distributionally robust approach to a stochastic binpacking problem subject to chance constraints on the total item sizes in the bins. They form the ambiguity set by all discrete distributions with known marginal means and variances for each item size.

They present a branch-and-price algorithm to solve the problem, and apply their results to a surgery scheduling problem for operating rooms. 5.2.6.3. Statistical Learning. Farnia and Tse <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref> study a DRO approach in the context of supervised learning problems to infer a function (i.e., decision rule) that predicts a response variable given a set of covariates. Motivated by the gametheoretic interpretation of Grünwald and Dawid and the principle of maximum entropy, they seek a decision rule that predicts the response based on a distribution that maximizes a generalized entropy function over a set of probability distributions. However, because the covariate information is available, they apply the principle of maximum entropy to the conditional distribution of the response given the covariates, see, also Globerson and Tishby <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref> for the case of Shannon entropy. Farnia and Tse <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref> form the ambiguity set of distributions by matching the marginal of to the empirical marginal of covariates while keeping the cross-moments between the response variables and covariates close enough (with respect to some norm) to that of the joint empirical distribution. They show that the DRO approach adopts a regularization interpretation for the maximum likelihood problem under the empirical distribution. As a result, Farnia and Tse <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref> recover the regularized maximum likelihood problem for generalized linear models for the following loss functions: linear regression under quadratic loss function, logistic regression under logarithmic loss function, and SVM under the 0-1 loss function.</p><p>Eban et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> study a DRO approach to a classification problem to minimize the worst-case hinge loss of missclassification, where the ambiguity set of the joint probability distributions of the discrete covariates and response should contain all distributions that agree with nominal pair-wise marginals.

Razaviyayn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">[253]</ref> study a DRO approach to the binary classification problem, with an ambiguity set similar to that of Eban et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, to minimize the worst-case missclassification probability. By changing the order of inf and sup, and smoothing the objective function, they obtain a probability distribution, based on which they propose a randomized classifier. They show that this randomized classifier enjoys a 2-approximation upper bound on the worst-case missclassification probability of the optimal solution to the studied DRO.</p><p>Mixture Distribution. In this section, we study DRO models, where the ambiguity set is formed via mixture distribution. A mixture distribution is defined as a convex combination of pdfs, known as the mixture components. The weights associated with the mixture components are called mixture probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref>. For example, a mixture model can be defined as the set of all mixtures of normal distributions with mean µ and standard deviation σ with parameter a = (µ, σ) in some compact set A ⊂ R 2 . In a more generic framework, the distribution P can be any mixture of probability distributions Q a ∈ M (Ξ, F), for some family of distributions {Q a } a∈A ∈ M (Ξ, F), that depends on the parameter vector a ∈ A as follows:</p><p>(5.28)</p><formula xml:id="formula_113">P (B) = A Q a (B) M (da), B ∈ F,</formula><p>where M is any probability distribution on A <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref>. Hence, modeling the ambiguity in the mixture probabilities may give rise to DRO model over the resultant or barycenter P of M <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[238]</ref>.</p><p>5.2.7.1. Risk and Chance Constraints. Lasserre and Weisser <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref> study a distributionally robust (individual and joint) chance-constrained program with a polynomial objective function, over a mixture ambiguity set and a semi-algebraic deterministic set. They approximate the ambiguous chance constraint with a polynomial whose vector coefficients is an optimal solution of a SDP. They show that the induced feasibility set by a nested sequence of such polynomial optimization approximation problems converges to that of the ambiguous chance constraints as the degree of approximate polynomials increases. <ref type="bibr">Kapsos et [169]</ref> introduce a probability Omega ratio for portfolio optimization (i.e., a probability weighted ratio of gains versus losses for some threshold return target). They study a distributionally robust counterpart of this ratio, where each distribution of the ratio can be represented through a mixture of some known prespecified distributions with unknown mixture probabilities. In particular, they study a mixture model for a nominal discrete distribution, where the mixture probabilities are modeled via the box uncertainty and ellipsoidal uncertainty models. In the former case, they reformulate the problem as a linear program, and in the latter case, they reformulate the problem as a SOCP.</p><p>Hanasusanto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref> study a distributionally robust newsvendor model with a mean-risk objective, as a convex combination of the worst-case CVaR and the worstcase expectation. The worst case is taken over all demand distributions within a multimodal ambiguity set, i.e., a mixture of a finite number of modes, where the conditional information on the ellipsoid support, mean, and covariance of each mode is known. The ambiguity in each mode is modeled via <ref type="bibr">(5.22)</ref>. They cast the resulting model as an exact SDP, and obtain a conservative semidefinite approximation by using quadratic decision rules to approximate the recourse decisions. Hanasusanto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref> further robustify their model against ambiguity in estimating the meancovariance information, caused from ambiguity about the mixture weights.

Popescu <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[238]</ref> uses conic duality to evaluate such lower and upper bounds via SDPs. The key to the development in Popescu <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[238]</ref> is to focus on ambiguity sets that posses a Choquet representation, where every distribution in the ambiguity set can be written as a mixture (i.e., an infinite convex combination) of measures in a generating set and in the virtue of (5.28). For univariate distributions, it is assumed that the generating set is defined by a Markov kernel. It is shown that if the optimal value of the problem is attained, there exists a worst-case probability measure that is a convex combination of m + 1 (recall m is the dimension of f ) (extremal) probability measures from the generating set. Popescu <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[238]</ref> uses the above result to obtain generalized Chebyshev's inequalities bounds for distributions of a univariate random variable that are (1) symmetric, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> unimodal with a given mode, (3) unimodal with bounds on the mode, (4) unimodal and symmetric, or (5) convex/concave monotone densities with bounds on the slope of densities. Popescu <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[238]</ref> further derives generalized Chebyshev's inequality for symmetric and unimodal distributions of multivariate random variables. A related notion to unimodality is α-unmiodality, which is defined as follows: Definition 5.14. Dharmadhikari and Joag-Dev <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> For α &gt; 0, a distribution</p><formula xml:id="formula_115">P ∈ P(R d , B(R d )) is called α-unimodal with mode a if P{t(A−a)} t α is nonincreasing in t &gt; 0 for all A ∈ B(R d ).</formula><p>Van Parys et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">[308]</ref> further extend the work of Popescu <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[238]</ref> to obtain worstcase probability bounds over α-unimodal multivariate distributions with the same mode and within the class of distributions in P DY , defined in <ref type="bibr">(5.22)</ref>, and on a polytopic support. They show that when the support of the random vector is an open polyhedron, this generalized Gauss bound can be obtained via a SDP. Similar to Popescu <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[238]</ref>, Van Parys et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">[308]</ref> derive semidefinite representations for worst-case probability bounds using Choquet representation of the ambiguity set. They demonstrate that classical generalized Chebyshev and Guass bounds 22 can be obtained as special cases of their result. They also show how to obtain a SDP reformulation to obtain the worst-case bound over α-multimodal multivariate distributions, defined via a mixture distribution.</p><p>By relying on information from classical statistics as well as robust statistics, Hanasusanto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> propose a unifying canonical ambiguity set that contains many ambiguity sets studied in the literature as special cases, including Gauss and median-absolute deviation ambiguity sets. Such a canonical framework is characterized through intersecting the cross-moment ambiguity set, proposed in Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318]</ref>, and a structural ambiguity set on the marginal distributions, representing information such as symmetry and α-unimodality. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[238]</ref>, the key to the development in et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> is to focus on structural ambiguity sets posses a Choquet representation. They study distributionally robust uncertainty quantification (i.e., a probabilistic objective function) and chance-constrained programs over the proposed ambiguity sets, where the safe region is characterized by a bi-affine expression in ξ and x. They study the ambiguity sets over which the resulting problems are reformulated as conic programming formulations. A summary of these results can be found in Hanasusanto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134,</ref><ref type="bibr">Table 2]</ref>. A by-product of their study is to recover some results from probability theory. For instance, by studying the worstcase probability of an event over the Chebyshev ambiguity set with a known mean and upper bound on the covariance matrix, they recover the generalized Chebyshev inequality, discovered in Popescu <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[238]</ref>, Vandenberghe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">[310]</ref>. Similarly, they recover the generalized Gauss inequality, discovered in Van Parys et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">[308]</ref>, by considering the Gauss ambiguity set. Furthermore, they propose computable conservative approximations for the chance-constrained problem. Recognizing that the uncertainty quantification problem is tractable over a broad range of ambiguity sets, their key idea for the proposed approximation scheme is to decompose the chanceconstrained problem into an uncertainty quantification problem that evaluates the worst-case probability of the chance constraint for a fixed decision x, followed by a decision improvement procedure.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[187]</ref> study distributionally robust chance-and CVaR-constrained stochastic programs, where the ambiguity set contains all α-unimodal distributions with the same first two order moments, and the safe region is bi-affine in both ξ and x. They show that these two ambiguous risk constraints can be cast as an infinite set of SOC constraints. They propose a separation approach to find the violated SOC constraints in an algorithmic fashion. They also derive conservative and relaxation approximations of the two SOC constraints by a finite number of constraints. These approximations for the CVaR-constrained problem are based on the results in Van Parys et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b309">[309]</ref>.</p><p>Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref> study a data-driven newsvendor problem to decide on the optimal order quantity and price. They assume that demand depends on the pricing, however, there is ambiguity about the price-demand function. To hedge against the misspecification of the demand function, they introduce a novel approach to this problem, called functionally robust approach, where the demand-price function is only known to be decreasing convex or concave. The proposed modeling approach in Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref> also provides a systematic view on the risk-reward trade-off of coordinating pricing and order quantity decisions based on the size of the ambiguity set. To solve the resulting minimax model, Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref> reduce the problem a univariate problem that seeks the optimal pricing and develop a two-sided cutting surface algorithm that generates function cuts to shrink the set of admissible functions.</p><p>To overcome the difficulty in evaluating extremal performance due to the lack of data, Lam and Mottet <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[178]</ref> study the computation of worst-case bounds under the geometric premise of the tail convexity. They show that the worst-case convex tail behavior is in a sense either extremely light-tailed or extremely heavy-tailed. 5.4. Kernel-Based Models. In Sections 5.1-5.3, we discussed different sets to model the distributional ambiguity. In all the papers we reviewed in those sections, the form of ambiguity set is endogenously chosen by decision makers. However, when facing high-dimensional uncertain it may not be practical to fix the form of ambiguity set a priori, being even more complicated with the calibration of different parameters describing the set (see 6). An alternative practice is to learn the form of the ambiguity set by using unsupervised learning algorithms on the historical data. Consider a given set of data {(u i , ξ i )} N i=1 , where u i ∈ R m is a vector of covariates associated with the uncertain parameter of interest</p><formula xml:id="formula_116">ξ i ∈ R d . Let K : R d × R d → R be a kernel function.</formula><p>Bertsimas and Kallus <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> propose a decision framework that incorporates the covariates u in addition to ξ into the optimization problem in the form of a conditionalstochastic optimization problem, where the decision-maker is seeking a predictive prescription x(u) that minimizes the conditional expectation of h(x, ξ) in anticipation of the future, given the observation u. However, the conditional distribution of ξ given u is not known and should be learned from data. Given {(u i , ξ i )} N i=1 , they suggest to find a data-driven predictive prescription that minimizes k i=1 w i k (u)h(x, ξ i ) over X . Functions w i k (u) are weights learned locally from the data, in a way that predictions are made based on the mean or mode of the past observations that are in some way similar to the one at hand.

The general framework of the proposed data-driven model in Bertsimas and Kallus <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> resembles SAA. They show that under mild conditions, the problem is polynomially solvable and the resulting predictive prescription is asymptotically optimal and consistent. However, it is worth noting that Bertsimas and Kallus <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> illustrate that direct usage of SAA on {ξ i } N i=1 and ignoring {u i } N i=1 can result in suboptimal decisions which are neither asymptotically optimal nor consistent.</p><p>A similar modeling framework as the conditional stochastic optimization problem studied in Bertsimas and Kallus <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is investigated in other papers, see, e.g., Hannah et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>, Deng and Sen [85], Ban and Rudin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Pang Ho and Hanasusanto <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">[225]</ref>, to incorporate machine learning into decision making. <ref type="bibr">Deng and Sen [85]</ref> use regression models such as k-nearest-neighbors regression to learn the conditional distribution of ξ given u.

But, different from Bertsimas and Kallus <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, they study a framework that simultaneously seeks a best statistical model and a corresponding decision policy. In their framework, in addition to {(u i , ξ i )} N i=1 , a new set of unlabeled data is available that in conjunction with the statistical model affects the cost. The minimum of such a cost function over the set of possible decisions is cast by a regularization term in the objective function of the learning algorithm. Tulabandhula and Rudin <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">[303]</ref> show that under some conditions this problem is equivalent to a robust optimization model, where the uncertainty set of the statistical model contains all models that are within -optimality from the predictive model describing {(u i , ξ i )} N i=1 . They illustrate the form of the uncertainty set for different loss functions in the predictive statistical model, including least squares, 0-1, logistic, exponential, ramp, and hing losses. Tulabandhula and Rudin <ref type="bibr" target="#b305">[305]</ref> study the application of the framework studied in Tulabandhula and Rudin <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">[303]</ref> to a travelling repairman problem, where a repair crew is seeking for an optimal route to repair the nodes on a graph while the failure probabilities are unknown.</p><p>Similar to Tulabandhula and Rudin <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">[303]</ref>, Tulabandhula and Rudin <ref type="bibr" target="#b304">[304]</ref> use a new set of unlabeled data in addition to {(u i , ξ i )} N i=1 in order to combine machine learning and decision making.

Their idea to form the uncertainty set of ξ to consider a class of "good" predictive models with low training error on the data set {(u i , ξ i )} N i=1 . Recognizing that the uncertainty can be decomposed into the predictive model uncertainty and residual uncertainty, they form the uncertainty by the Minkowski sum of two sets: (1) predictions of the new data set with the class of "good" predictive models, and (2) residuals of the new data set with the class of "good" predictive models. To form the class of "good" predictive models, one can use loss functions such as least squares and hing loss.</p><p>Similar to Bertsimas and Kallus <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, Bertsimas and Van Parys <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> consider the problem of finding an optimal solution to a data-driven stochastic optimization problem, where the uncertain parameter is affected by a large number of covariates. They study a distributionally robust approach to this problem formed via Kullback-Leibler divergence. By borrowing from the statistical bootstrap, they propose two prescriptive methods based on the Nadaraya-Watson and nearest-neighbors learning formulation, first introduced by Bertsimas and Kallus <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, which safeguards against overfitting and lead to an improved out-of-sample performance. Both resulting prescriptive methods reduce to tractable convex optimization problems.</p><p>Kernel density estimation (KDE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref> in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) is also used in the RO literature to construct the uncertainty set <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">[217]</ref>. PCA captures the correlation between uncertain parameters and transfoms data into their corresponding uncorrelated principal components. KDE, then, captures the distributional information of the transformed, uncorrelated uncertain parameters along the principal components, by using kernel smoothing methods. Ning and You <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">[217]</ref> propose to use Gaussian kernel K defined between the latent uncertainty along the principal component k, w k , and the projected data along the principal component k, t k 23 . By incorporating forward and backward deviations to allow for asymmetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, Ning and You <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">[217]</ref> propose the following polytopic uncertainty set that resembles the intersection of a box, with the so-called budget, and polyhedral uncertainty</p><formula xml:id="formula_122">U =            u u = µ 0 + V w, w = w z − + w z , 0 ≤ z − , z + ≤ 1, z − + z + ≤ 1, 1 (z − + z + ) ≤ Γ, w = [F −1 1 (α), . . . , F −1 m (α)] , w = [F −1 1 (1 − α), . . . , F −1 m (1 − α)]            .

It is shown that commonly used kernel functions in SVC, such as polynomial, radial basis function, sigmoid function kernel, lead to an intractable robust counterpart problem for the corresponding uncertainty set. Hence, Shang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">[282]</ref> propose to use a piecewise linear kernel, referred to as a weighted generalized intersection kernel, defined as follows:</p><p>(5.30)</p><formula xml:id="formula_126">K(u, v) = m k=1 l k − Q(u − v) 1 ,</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_127">Q = S − 1 2 and S = 1 N N i=1 u i (u i ) − N i=1 u i N i=1 u i , and l k , k = 1, . . . , m, is chosen such that l k &gt; max N i=1 Q •k u i − min N i=1 Q •k u i .</formula><p>Such a kernel not only incorporates covariance information, but also gives rise to the following results.  Shang and You <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">[280]</ref> further propose to calibrate the radius of the uncertainty set and provide a probabilistic guarantee of the proposed uncertainty set. Shang and You <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">[278]</ref> use PCA in combination with SVC to construct the uncertainty set. By employing PCA, the data space is decomposed into the principal subspace and residual subspace. Then, they the uncertainty set formed in Shang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">[282]</ref> to explain the variation in the principal subspace, and utilize a polyhedral set to explain noise in the residual subspace. The proposed uncertainty set is then the intersection of the above two sets. Shang and You <ref type="bibr" target="#b279">[279]</ref> adopt the ambiguity set proposed in Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318]</ref>, and propose to use PCA to calibrate the moment functions. In fact, a moment function in their model is a piecewise linear function, which is defined as a first-order deviation of the uncertain parameter along a certain projection direction, truncated at certain points.

General Ambiguity Sets. In Sections 5.1-5.4, we reviewed papers with specific distributional and structural properties for the random parameters, captured via discrepancy-based, moment-based, shape-preserving, and kernel-based ambiguity sets. In this section, we review papers that either do not consider any specific form for the ambiguity set or provide some general results for a broad class of ambiguty sets.</p><p>A unified scenario-wise format for ambiguity sets to contain both the moment-based and discrepancy-based distributional information about the ambiguous distribution is proposed in Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. It is shown that the ambiguity sets formed via generalized moments, mixture distribution, Wasserstein metric, φ-divergence, kmeans clustering, among other, all can be represented under this unified ambiguity set. The key feature of this scenario-wise ambiguity set is the introduction of a discrete random variable, which represents a finite number of scenarios that would affect the distributional ambiguity of the underlying nominal random variable. This ambiguity set can be characterized by a finite number of (conditional) expectation constraints based on generalized moments Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318]</ref>. For practical purposes, they restrict the ambiguity set to be second-order conic representable. Based on the scenario-wise ambiguity set, they introduce an adaptive robust optimization format that unifies the classical SP and (distributionally) RO models with recourse.</p><p>They also introduce a scenario-wise affine recourse approximation to provide tractable solutions to the adaptive robust optimization model. Besides Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, there are some proposals for unified models in the context of discrepancy-based, moment-based, and shape-preserving models. As mentioned before, a broad class of moment-based ambiguity sets with conic-representable expectation constraints and a collection of nested conic-representable confidence sets is proposed in Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318]</ref>, and a broad class of shape-preserving ambiguity sets is proposed in Hanasusanto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>. Luo and Mehrotra <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[199]</ref> study DRO problem where the ambiguity sets of probability distributions can depend on the decision variables. They consider a wide range of moment-and discrepancy-based ambiguity sets formed, such as (1) measure and moment inequalities (see Section 5.2.3), (2) bounds on moment constraints (see Section 5.2.1), (3) 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing 1 -norm, (4) φ-divergences, and (5) Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

They demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are finitely convergent if a distribution separation subproblem can be solved in a finite number of iterations, as in sets formed via P MM , defined in (5.23), 1-Wasserstein metric utilizing an arbitrary norm, and the total variation distance.

They propose lifted cover valid inequalities for the binary bilinear knapsack substructure induced by a given bin and scenario, and they further obtain lifted cover inequalities that are valid for the substrcture induced by each bin. They obtain valid probability cuts and incorporate them with the lifted cover inequalities in a branch-and-cut framework to solve the model.

Choice of the Nominal Parameters. All discrepancy-based ambiguity sets, studied in Section 5.1, and some of the moment-based ambiguity sets, studied in Section 5.2, rely on some nominal input parameters, for instance, the nominal distribution P 0 in the ambiguity set P W (P 0 , ), defined in (5.3), and parameters µ 0 and Σ 0 in the ambiguity set P DY , defined in <ref type="bibr">(5.22)</ref>. In this section, we discuss how these parameters are chosen in a data-driven setting.</p><p>The nominal distribution P 0 in the discrepancy-based ambiguity sets is usually obtained by the maximal likelihood estimator of the true unknown distribution. In the discrete case, P 0 is typically chosen as the empirical distribution on data. In the case that the true unknown distribution is continuous, Jiang and Guan <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref> and Zhao and Guan <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">[342]</ref> propose to obtain P 0 with nonparametric kernel density estimation methods, see, e.g., Devroye and Gyorfi <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>.</p><p>Delage and Ye <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> propose to estimate µ 0 and Σ 0 by their empirical estimates (see Section 6.2 for more details on how this choice of nominal parameters, in conjuction other assumptions, ensure that the constructed ambiguity set P DY contains the true unknown probability distribution with a high probability).</p><p>6.2. Choice of Robustness Parameters. In Section 5, we different approaches to form the ambiguity set of distributions. All discrepancy-based ambiguity sets, studied in Section 5.1, and some of the moment-based ambiguity sets, studied in Section 5.2, rely on parameters that control the size of the ambiguity set. For instance, parameter in the ambiguity set P W (P 0 ; ), defined in (5.3), and parameters 1 and 2 in the ambiguity set P DY , defined in <ref type="bibr">(5.22)</ref>, control the size of their corresponding ambiguity sets. A judicial choice of these parameters reduce the level of conservatism of the resulting DRO. A natural question is then how to choose appropriate values for these parameters.</p><p>In this section, we review different approaches to choose the level-of-robustness parameters. To have a structured review, we make a distinction between data-driven DRO and non-data-driven DRO.</p><p>6.2.1. Data-Driven DROs. Data-driven DROs usually propose a robustness parameter that is inversely proportional to the number of available data points. This construction is motivated from the asymptotic convergence of the optimal value of DRO to that of the corresponding model under the true unknown distribution, with an increasing number of data points, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[229,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</p><p>An underlying assumption data-driven methods is that data points are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from the unknown distribution. Given this assumption, data-driven approaches for discrepancy-based ambiguity sets propose to choose the level of robustness by analyzing the discrepancy-with respect to some metric-between the empirical distribution and the true unknown distribution 24 , asymptotically, see, e.g., Ben-Tal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Shafieezadeh-Abadeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">[273]</ref>, or with a finite sample, see, e.g., Pflug and Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[229]</ref>. A direct consequence of such analysis is that it establishes a finite-sample probabilistic guarantee on the discrepancy between the empirical distribution and the true unknown distribution. Hence, it gives rise to a probabilistic guarantee on the inclusion of the unknown distribution in the constructed set, with respect to the empirical distribution. By construction, such an ambiguity set can be as a confidence set on the true unknown distribution. Moreover, such a construction implies a finite-sample guarantee on the out-of-sample performance, so that the current optimal value provides an upper bound on the out-of-sample performance of the current solution with a high probability. A similar idea is used in moment-based ambiguity sets, see, e.g., Goldfarb and Iyengar <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref> and Delage and Ye <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. In a recent work, Gotoh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref> propose to choose the level of robustness by trading off between the mean and variance of the out-ofsample objective function value. We refer the readers to that paper for a review of calibration approaches in DRO.</p><p>Below, we review the data-driven approaches to choose the level of robustness in more details. In this section, we suppose that a set {ξ i } N i=1 of i.i.d data, distributed according to P true , is available, where P N denotes the empirical probability distribution of data. 6.2.1.1. Optimal Transport Discrepancy. When the ambiguity set contains all discrete distributions around the empirical distribution in the sense of the Wasserstein metric, Pflug and Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[229]</ref> and Pflug et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[233]</ref> propose to choose the level of robustness based on a probabilistic statement on the Wasserstein metric between the empirical and true distributions, due to Dudley <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>, as = CN − 1 d α . This choice of guarantees that P{d W c (P, P N ) ≥ } ≤ α. In addition to the confidence level 1 − α and the number of available data points N , the proposed level of robustness in <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[229,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b233">233]</ref> depends on the dimension of ξ, d, and a constant C. For such a Wasserstein-based ambiguity set, one can also choose the size of the set by utilizing the probabilistic statement on the discrepancy between empirical distribution and the true unknown distribution, established in Fournier and Guillin <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>. Nevertheless, because all the utilized probabilistic statements rely on the exogenous constant C, the size of the ambiguity set calculated from the theoretical analysis may be very conservative; hence, such proposals are not practical.</p><p>By acknowledging the issue raised above, some researchers propose to choose the level of robustness without relying on exogenous constants. For cases that the ambiguity set contains all discrete distributions, supported on a compact space and around the empirical distribution, Ji and Lejeune <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref> derive a closed-form expression for computing the size of the Wasserstein-based ambiguity set. for some ξ 0 . Let θ := sup{d(ξ 1 , ξ 2 ) : ξ 1 , ξ 2 ∈ Ω} be the diameter of Ω. Then,</p><formula xml:id="formula_130">P N {d W d (P true , P N ) ≤ } ≥ 1 − exp − N 4 (4θ + 3) + (4θ + 3) 2 4θ + 3 − 1 2 . Moreover, if ≥ θ + 3 4 − 1 N log α + 2 − 1 N log α , then P N {d W d (P true , P N ) ≤ } ≥ 1 − α.</formula><p>Unlike the result in and Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[229]</ref>, the proposed level of in Ji and Lejeune <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref>, stated in Theorem 6.1, depends only on the confidence level α, the number of available data points, and the diameter of the compact support Ω. Ji and Lejeune <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref> obtain this result by bounding the Wasserstein distance between two probability distributions from above, using the properties of the weighted total variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, and the weighted Csiszar-Kullback-Pinsker inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b312">[312]</ref>, and consequently applying Sanov's large deviation theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> to reach a probabilistic statement on the Wasserstein distance between two distributions. As stated in Theorem 6.1, such a result guarantees that the constructed set contains the unknown probability distribution with a high probability. Moreover, it implies a probabilistic guarantee on the true optimal value.</p><p>Another criticism of methods such as those proposed in Pflug and Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[229]</ref> and Pflug et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[233]</ref> is that they merely rely on the discrepancy between two probability distributions, and the optimization framework plays no role in the prescription. By making connection between the regularizer parameter and the size of the ambiguity for Wassersetin-based sets, Blanchet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> aim to optimally choose the regularization parameter. A key component of their analysis is a robust Wasserstein profile (RWP) function. At a given solution x, this function calculates the minimum Wasserstein distance from the nominal distribution to the set of optimal probability distributions for the inner at x. For any confidence level α, they show that the size of the ambiguity set should be chosen as (1 − α)-quantile of RWP at the optimal solution to the minimization problem under the true unknown distribution. Using this selection of , the optimal solution to the true problem belongs to the set of optimal solutions to the DRO problem, with (1 − α) confidence for all P ∈ P W (P N , ). As such a result is based on the true optimal solution, they study the asymptotic behavior of the RWP function and discuss how to use it to optimally choose the regularization parameter without cross validation. The work in Blanchet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> is extended in Blanchet and Kang <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. Blanchet and Kang <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> utilize the RWP to introduce a data-driven (statistical) criterion for the optimal choice of the regularization parameter and study its asymptotic behavior. For a DRO approach to linear regression, Chen and Paschalidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> give guidance on the selection of the regularization parameter from the standpoint of a confidence region. 6.2.1.2. Goodness-of-Fit Test. Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> propose to form the ambiguity set of distributions using the confidence set of the unknown distribution via goodness-of-fit tests. With such an approach, one chooses the level of robustness as the threshold value of the corresponding test, depending on the confidence level α, data, and the null hypothesis. 6.2.1.3. φ-Divergences. By noting that the class of φ-divergences can be used in statistical hypothesis tests, a similar approach to the one in Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> can be used to choose the level of robustness for φ-divergence-based ambiguity sets. For the case that the distributional ambiguity in discrete distributions is modeled via φ-divergences, some papers propose to choose the level of robustness by relying on the asymptotic behavior of the discrepancy between the empirical distribution and true unknown distribution, see, e.g., Ben-Tal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Bayraksan and Love <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Yanıkoglu and den Hertog <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[337]</ref>.</p><p>Suppose that Ξ is finite sample space of size m and the φ-divergence function in (5.9) is twice continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of 1, with φ (1) &gt; 0. Then, it is shown in Pardo <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">[226]</ref> that under the true distribution, the statistics 2N φ (1) D φ (P true , P 0 ) converges in distribution to a χ 2 m−1 -distribution, with m−1 degrees of freedom. Thus, at a given confidence level α, one can set the level of robustness to φ (1)  2N χ 2 m−1,1−α , where χ 2 m−1,1−α is the (1 − α)-quantile of χ 2 m−1 , to obtain an (approximate) confidence set on the true unknown distribution. Ben-Tal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> show that such a choice of the level of robustness gives a one-sided confidence interval with (asymptotically) inexact coverage on the true optimal value of inf x∈X E P true h(x, ξ) .</p><p>For corrections for small sample sizes, we refer readers to Pardo <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">[226]</ref>.</p><p>By generalizing the empirical likelihood framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">[224]</ref> on a separable metspace (not necessarily finite), Duchi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> propose to choose the level of robustness such that a confidence interval [l N , u N ] on the true optimal value of inf x∈X E P true h(x, ξ) has an asymptotically exact coverage 1 − α, i.e., . Duchi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> also give rates at which u N −l N → 0. Moreover, the upper confidence interval (−∞, u N ] is a one-sided confidence interval with an asymptotic exact coverage when = χ 2 1,1−2α . On another note, it can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> that the φ-divergence function corresponding to the variation distance is not twice differentiable at 1. Hence, one cannot use the above result. However, by utilizing the first inequality in Lemma 5.4, i.e., the relationship between the variation distance and the Hellinger distance, Jiang and Guan <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref> propose to set the level of robustness to 1 N χ 2 m−1,1−α in order to obtain an (approximate) confidence set on the true unknown discrete distribution. The proposed choice of the level of robustness ensures that the unknown discrete distribution belongs to the ambiguity set with a high probability. For the case that ξ follows a continuous distribution, the proposed level of robustness in <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref> depends on some constants that appear in the probabilistic statement of the discrepancy between the empirical distributions and the true distribution.</p><p>6.2.1.4. p -Norm. For the case that ∞ -norm is used to model the distributional ambiguity, Jiang and Guan <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref> propose to choose the level of robustness based on a probabilistic statement on the discrepancy between the empirical distributions and the distribution as = 2 )-quantile of the standard normal distribution, and p 0 := [p 1 0 , . . . , p m 0 ] denotes the empirical distribution of data. The proposed choice of the level of robustness ensures that the unknown discrete distribution belongs to the ambiguity set with a high probability. Similar to the 1 -norm (i.e., the variation distance) case, when ξ follows a continuous distribution, the proposed level of robustness depends on some constants that appear in the probabilistic statement of the discrepancy between the empirical distributions and the true distribution. 6.2.1.5. ζ-Structure. By exploiting the relationship between different metrics the ζ-structure family, see, e.g., Lemma 5.7, Zhao and Guan <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">[342]</ref> provide guidelines on how to choose the level of robustness for the ambiguity sets of the unknown discrete distribution formed via bounded Lipschitz, Kantorovich, and Fortet-Mourier metrics as follows.</p><p>Theorem 6.3. Suppose that the random vector ξ is supported on a bounded finite space Ω and θ denotes the diameter of Ω, as defined in Theorem 6.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(i) if</head><p>≥ θ −2 log α N , then P N {d K (P true , P N ) ≤ } ≥ 1 − α and P N {d BL (P true , P N ) ≤ } ≥ 1 − α.</p><p>(ii) if ≥ θ max{1, θ q−1 } −2 log α N , then P N {d FM (P true , P N ) ≤ } ≥ 1 − α. Proof. The proof is immediate from the relationship between ζ-structure metrics, stated in Lemma 5.7, and the fact that P N {d K (P true , P N ) ≤ } ≥ 1 − exp{− 2 N 2θ 2 } due to Zhao and Guan <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">[342,</ref><ref type="bibr">Proposition 3]</ref>. As it can be seen from Theorem 6.3, the proposed levels of robustness for the case that the unknown distribution is discrete depend on the diameter of Ω, the number of data points N , and the confidence level 1 − α. However, the results in Zhao and Guan <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">[342]</ref> for the continuous case suffer from similar practical issues as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[229,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b233">233,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">167]</ref>. 6.2.1.6. Chebyshev. A data-driven approach to construct a Chebyshev ambiguity set is proposed in Goldfarb and Iyengar <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>. Recall the linear model for the asset returns ξ in Goldfarb and Iyengar <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>: ξ = µ + A f + ˜ , where µ is the vector of mean returns, f ∼ N (0, Σ) is the vector of random returns that derives the market, A is the factor loading matrix, and ˜ ∼ N (0, B) is the vector of residual returns with a diagonal matrix D. Under the assumption that the covariance matrix Σ is known, recall that Goldfarb and Iyengar <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>  where c i denotes the i-th column of C, and c i g = c i Gc i denotes the elliptic norm of c i with respect to a symmetric positive definite matrix G. Calibrating the uncertainty sets U B , U A , and U µ involves choosing parameters d i , d i , ρ i , γ i , i = 1, . . . , d, vector µ 0 , and matrices A 0 and G. Assuming that a set of data points is available on ξ and f , by relying on the multivariate linear regression, Goldfarb and Iyengar <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref> obtain least square estimates (µ 0 , A 0 ) of (µ, A), respectively, and construct a multdimensional confidence region of (µ, A) around (µ 0 , A 0 ). Now, projecting this confidence region along vector A and matrix µ gives the corresponding uncertainty sets U A and U µ , respectively. To form the uncertainty set U B , they propose to use a bootstrap confidence interval around the regression error of the residual. </p><formula xml:id="formula_131">¯ 1 = γ2 1 − γ1 − γ2 , ¯ 2 = 1 + γ2 1 − γ1 − γ2 ,</formula><p>where ᾱ = 1 − √ 1 − α. Let P DY (Ω, μ0 , Σ0 , ¯ 1 , ¯ 2 ) the ambiguity set formed via (5.22), using parameters μ0 , Σ0 , ¯ 1 , and ¯ 2 . Then, we have P N {P true ∈ P DY (Ω, μ0 , Σ0 , ¯ 1 , ¯ 2 )} ≥ 1 − α. 6.2.2. Non-Data-Driven DROs. As mentioned before, data-driven DROs typically assume that a set of i.i.d. sampled data is available from the unknown true distribution. In many situations, however, there is no guarantee that the future uncertainty is drawn from the same distribution. Recognizing this fact, some research is devoted to choosing the level of robustness in situations where the i.i.d. assumption is violated and data-driven methods to calibrate the level of robustness may be unsuitable.</p><p>Rahimian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">[252]</ref> use the notions of maximal effective subsets and prices of optimism/pessimism and nominal/worst-case regrets to calibrate the level of robustness in discrepancy-based DRO models. Price of optimism pessimism is defined as the loss by being too optimistic (i.e., using SO model with the nominal distribution)-and hence, implementing the corresponding solution-while DRO accurately represents the ambiguity in the distribution. Similarly, the price of pessimism is defined as the loss by being too pessimistic (i.e., using RO model with no distributional information except for the support of uncertainty). Nominal/worst-case regret is defined as the loss of being unnecessarily ambiguous/not being ambiguous enough-and hence, implementing the corresponding solution-while DRO is ill-calibrated. Rahimian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">[252]</ref> suggest to balance the price of optimism and pessimism if the decision-maker is indifferent regarding the error from using too optimistic or pessimistic solutions. They refer to the smallest level of robustness for which such a balance happens as indifferent-to-solution level of robustness. On the other hand, Rahimian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">[252]</ref> propose to balance the nominal and worst-case regrets if the decision-maker wants to be indifferent regarding the error from using an ill-calibrated DRO model in either the optimistic or the pessimistic scenarios. They refer to the smallest level of robustness for which such a balance happens as indifferent-to-distribution level of robustness.</p><p>7. Cost Function of the Inner Problem. Recall formulation (DRO) and the functional R P : Z → R. This functional accounts for quantifying the uncertainty in the outcomes of a fixed decision x ∈ X and for a given fixed probability measure P ∈ M (Ξ, F). As pointed out before in Section 1.1 for (1.1) and (1.2), one choice for this functional is the expectation operator. Other functionals, such as regret function, risk measure, and utility function have also been used in the DRO literature. These functionals are closely related concepts and we refer to Ben-Tal and Teboulle <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[259]</ref> for a comprehensive treatment and how one can induce one from the other. In this section, we review some notable works, where regret function, risk measure, and utility function are used to capture the uncertainty in the outcomes of the decision.</p><p>7.1. Regret Function. Given a decision x ∈ X and a probability measure P ∈ M (Ξ, F), a regret functional V P may quantify the displeasure or disappointment of the current decision with respect to a possible mix of future outcomes as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_132">V P h(x, ξ) := E P h(x, ξ) − min x∈X h(x, ξ) .</formula><p>In other words, V P h(x, ξ) calculates the expected additional loss that could have been avoided. This definition of regret function is used in Natarajan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[212]</ref> and Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> in the context of combinatorial optimization and multicriteria decision-making, respectively. Another way for formulating a regret function may be as V P h(x, ξ) := E P h(x, ξ) − min This type of regret function is used in Perakis and Roels <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">[228]</ref> in the context of the newsvendor problem. Perakis and Roels <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">[228]</ref> obtain closed form solutions to distributionally robust single-item newsvendor problems that minimize the worst-case expected regret of acting optimally, where only (1) support, (2) mean, (3) mean and and (4) mean and variance information is available. This information can be captured with the ambiguity set P MM , defined in <ref type="bibr">(5.23)</ref>. Perakis and Roels <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">[228]</ref> also study the ambiguity sets that preserve the shape of the distribution, including information on (1) mean and symmetry, (2) support and unimodality with a given mode, (3) median and unimodality with a given mode, and (4) mean, symmtery, and unimodality with a given mode. 7.2. Risk Measure. As introduced in Section 3.3.1, a functional that quantifies the uncertainty in the outcomes of a decision is a risk measure Artzner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Acerbi <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Kusuoka <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref>, Shapiro <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[287]</ref>. A risk measure ρ P usually satisfies some averseness property, i.e., ρ P [•] &gt; E P [•] and imposes a preference order on random variables, i.e., if Z, Z ∈ Z and Z ≥ Z , then ρ P [Z] ≥ ρ P [Z ]. Explicit incorporation of a risk measure into a DRO model has also received attention in the literature. We refer to Pflug et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[233]</ref>, Pichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[235]</ref>, Wozabal <ref type="bibr" target="#b320">[320]</ref>, Pichler and Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[236]</ref> for spectral and distortion risk measures, Calafiore <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> for variance, Calafiore <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> for mean absolutedeviation, Hanasusanto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>, Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318]</ref> for optimized certainty equivalent, Hanasusanto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref> for CVaR, and Postek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">[240]</ref> for a variety of risk measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Utility</head><p>Function. An alternative to using risk measures to compare random variables is to evaluate their expected utility Gilboa and Schmeidler <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>. As before, let us consider a probability space (Ξ, F, P ). A random variable Z ∈ Z is preferred over a random variable Z ∈ Z if E P [u(Z 1 )] ≥ E P [u(Z 2 )] for a given univariate utility function u 26 . A bounded utility function u can be normalized to take values between 0 and 1, and hence, it can be interpreted as a cdf of a random variable ζ, i.e., u(t) = P {ζ ≤ t} for t ∈ R. Under this interpretation, Z is preferred over Z if P {Z ≥ ζ} ≥ P {Z ≥ ζ} because E P [u(Z)] = E P [P {ζ ≤ Z|Z}] = P E P 1 {ζ≤Z} |Z = E P 1 {ζ≤Z} = P {ζ ≤ Z}.</p><p>However, as in decision theory, it is difficult to have a complete knowledge of a decision maker's preference (i.e., utility function), it is also difficult to have a complete knowledge of the cdf of ζ. The notion of stochastic dominance handles this issue by comparing the expected utility of random variables, for a given family U of utility functions, or equivalently, compare the probability of exceeding the target random variable ζ for a given family of cdf. Consequently, to address the problem of ambiguity in decision maker's utility or equivalently, cdf of the random variable ζ, one can study where U denotes a given family of normalized and nondecreasing utility functions, or equivalently, a given family of cdf. Note that problems (7.1) and (7.2) have the form of problems (1.5) and (1.6), respectively. Hu and Mehrotra <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref> study problem of the form (7.1), where U is further restricted to include concave utility functions or equivalently, cdf, and satisfy functional bounds on the utility and marginal utility functions (cdf and pdf of ζ) as in <ref type="bibr">(5.23)</ref>. They provide a linear programming formulation of a particular case where the bounds on the utility function are piecewise linear increasing concave functions, and the bounds on all other functions are step functions. For the general continuous case, they study an approximation problem by discretisizing the continuous functions, and analyze the convergence properties of the approximated problem. They apply their results to a portfolio optimization problem. Unlike Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref>, in Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>, no shape restrictions on the utility function is assumed and only functional bounds on the utility function are enforced. Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref> show that an SAA approach to the Lagrangian dual of the resulting problem can be used while solving a mixed-integer LP. They study the convergence properties of this SAA problem, and illustrate their results using examples in portfolio optimization and a streaming bandwidth allocation problem. Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> study a DRO model of the form (1.5), where a convex nondecreasing disutility function is used to quantify the uncertainty in decision. A utility function is closely related to risk measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>. For instance, for a given probability measure, the expected utility might have the form of a combination of expectation and expected excess beyond a target, or an optimized certainty equivalent risk measure. As shown in Ben-Tal and Teboulle <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, under appropriate choices of utility functions, an optimized certainty equivalent risk measure can be reduced to the mean-variance and the mean-CVaR formulations. Wiesemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[318]</ref> study a DRO model formed via <ref type="bibr">(5.26)</ref>, where the decision maker is risk-averse via a nondecreasing convex piecewise affine disutility function.</p><p>In particular, they investigate shortfall risk and optimized certainty equivalent risk measures.</p><p>Unlike the above discussion, many decision-making problems involve comparing random vectors. One can generalize the notion of utility-based comparison to random vectors by using multivariate utility functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Another approach to compare random vectors is based on the idea of the weighted scalarization of random vectors. For the case that the weights are deterministic and take value in an arbitrary set, we refer to Dentcheva and Ruszczyński <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> for unrestricted sets, Homem-De-Mello and Mehrotra <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>, Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>, Hu and Mehrotra <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref> for polyhedral sets, and Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref> for convex sets. For instance, Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> study a weighted sum approach to a multiobjective budget allocation problem under uncertain performance indicators of projects. They assume that the weights take value in the convex hull of the weights suggested by experts and study a minmax approach to the expected weighted sum problem, where the expectation is taken with respect to the uncertainty in the performance indicators and the worst-case is taken with respect to the weights. Note that the problem studied in Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> is in the framework of RO as the weights are deterministic.</p><p>The idea of using stochastic weights, governed by probability measure that determines the relative importance of each vector of weights, is also introduced in Hu and Mehrotra <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref> and Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref>. For instance, Hu and Mehrotra <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref> study a DRO approach to stochastically weighted multiobjective deterministic and stochastic optimization problems, where the weights are perturbed along different rays from a reference weight vector. They study the reformulations of the deterministic problem for the cases where the weights take values in (1) a polyhedral set, including those induced by a simplex, 1 -norm, and ∞ -norm, and (2) a set, including those induced by a single cone (e.g., p -norm, ellipsoids), intersection of multiple cones, and union of multiple cones. They further study the stochastic optimization problem. For the case that the weights and random parameters are independent, and the ambiguity in the probability distribution of weights is modeled via <ref type="bibr">(5.22)</ref>, they obtain a reformulation of the problem using the result in Delage and Ye <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. For the case that the weights and random parameters are dependent, they also obtain reformulations of the resulting problem by utilizing the result from the deterministic case. They illustrate the ideas set forth in the paper using examples from disaster planning and agriculture revenue management problems.</p><p>8. Modeling Toolboxes. Goh and Sim <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref> develop a MATLAB-based algebraic modeling toolbox, named ROME, for a class of DRO problems with conicrepresentable sets for the support and mean, known covariance matrix, and upper bounds on the directional deviations studied in Goh and Sim <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>. Goh and Sim <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref> elucidate the practicability of this toolbox in the context of (1) a service-constrained inventory management problem, (2) a project-crashing problem, and (3) a portfolio optimization problem. A C++-based algebraic modeling package, named ROC, is developed in Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, to demonstrate the practicability and scalability of the studied adaptive DRO model. Some features of ROC include declaration of uncertain parameters and linear decision rules, transcriptions of ambiguity sets, and reformulation of DRO using the results obtained in Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. A brief introduction to ROC and some illustrative examples to declare the objects of a model, such as variables, constraints, ambiguity set, among others, are given in an early version of Bertsimas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.
